night-weaning,"Night feeding: what to expect

It’s common for babies to wake at night during the first year of life. They wake to feed, and they also wake for comfort.

As babies get older, they usually wake less often at night to feed.

Thinking about night weaning and phasing out night feeds?

If you’re comfortable with feeding your child during the night, there’s no hurry to phase out night feeds. You can choose what works best for you and your child.

Before you decide to night wean or phase out night feeds, it’s a good idea to talk with your child and family health nurse or GP to get advice that suits your individual situation.

Night weaning breastfed children

It’s OK to think about night weaning for healthy breastfed children from 12 months of age.

At this age, most children are getting enough food during the day for their growth and development. But before 12 months, night weaning breastfed babies can reduce your milk supply.

Here’s how to get started with night weaning for breastfed children.

Short night feed

If your child’s night feed is short (less than 5 minutes), you can phase out night feeds by stopping the feed altogether and re-settling your child using sleep and settling techniques that work best for you and your baby. Note that it might take several nights for you and your child to get used to the new routine.

Longer night-time feed

If your child’s night feed is usually longer than 5 minutes, you can gradually cut down the time you spend feeding over 5-7 nights. This will help your child get used to the change. Here’s how:

Reduce the time your child feeds by 2-5 minutes every second night. For example, if your child usually feeds for 10 minutes, feed for 8 minutes for 2 nights, then 6 minutes for the next 2 nights, and so on.

Re-settle your child after each shortened feed with the settling techniques of your choice.

Follow your child’s lead. If your child becomes very distressed, you might stop weaning for a while.

Things to keep in mind

If you decide to try night weaning, your child still gets all the benefits of breastmilk if you keep breastfeeding during the day.

Your child might want to feed more for comfort when big changes are happening. For example, they might need more comfort if they’re starting child care.

If your child needs night-time comfort but not night feeds, your partner (if you have one) could settle your child at night.

Phasing out night feeds for formula-fed babies

For formula-fed babies, you can think about phasing out night feeds from 6 months of age.

If your baby is formula fed and aged over 6 months, they’re unlikely to be waking at night because they’re hungry. This is because infant formula is digested more slowly than breastmilk.

Night-time feed of 60 ml of milk or less

If you decide to try phasing out night feeds and your baby is having 60 ml of milk or less during a night feed, you can stop the feed altogether and re-settle your baby with the settling techniques that work best for you and your baby.

Night-time feed of more than 60 ml of milk

If your baby’s feed is more than 60 ml each night, you can gradually cut down the amount your baby drinks over 5-7 nights.

Here’s how:

Reduce the volume of milk by 20-30 ml every second night. For example, if your baby usually drinks 180 ml, you would give 150 ml for 2 nights, then 120 ml for the next 2 nights, and so on.

Re-settle your baby after each smaller feed with the settling techniques of your choice.

Once you get down to 60 ml or less in the bottle, stop the feed altogether."
sleeping-away-from-home,"About sleeping away from home

At some point your child might need to sleep away from home without you.

This might be when your child goes to child care and is still having daytime naps. Or there might be times when you need to be away for work or you work late, so your child needs to sleep at a relative’s or friend’s house.

You might also be thinking about your child having a sleepover with their grandparents or other relatives so you can have a night out. Or you might want to strengthen the relationship between your child and their extended family members with a special activity like a sleepover. In this situation, it’s best to be guided by whether you think your child is ready.

Either way, it might help to know that most children learn to cope with sleeping away from home.

Preparing children to sleep away from home

If your child will be sleeping away from home without you, knowing what’s going to happen can help your child feel safer and happier.

For toddlers, it’s a good idea to explain what’s going to happen in words they can understand. For example, ‘You’re having a sleepover at Nanna’s. She’ll give you milk and a story before bed, just like we do at home. I’ll see you tomorrow’.

For preschoolers, you can give as much information as you think they can handle about:

where they’re going

who’ll be looking after them

where and when they’ll be sleeping

when you’ll be back.

The ‘What if?’ game is also a great way to prepare children for new experiences like sleeping away from home without you. For example, you could ask, ‘What will you do if you wake up during the night? That’s right, you’ll call out to Nanna’.

You can make it fun by drawing pictures of what’s going to happen or by talking about the person your child is going to visit. Seeing photos of the person or speaking with the person on the phone might also help your child. You could even do a fun camp-out in the family room at home first.

Maintaining children’s sleep routines away from home

Doing the same things away from home can help your child adapt to unfamiliar places, so sleeping away can be easier if you can maintain your child’s usual sleep routine.

If your child will be sleeping away from home at child care, it might help to know that most child care centres will try to follow children’s regular feeding, sleeping and play routines, especially for babies.

It can help if you describe your child’s sleep routine to anyone who’ll be caring for your child away from home, like grandparents, relatives, early childhood educators and carers, and so on. For example, ‘Levi likes a story before his nap’, ‘Lani’s routine is bottle-feed at 6 pm, bath at 6.30 pm, and bed at 7 pm’ or ‘Lil settles well with a quiet lullaby’.

For overnight stays, it’s a good idea to pack anything special that helps your child settle for sleep, like a teddy, blanket or favourite pair of pyjamas. If you use a night light, white noise machine or something else to control light and noise while your child is asleep, make sure you pack these too.

You can also let carers know about things your child might need during naps or at night. For example, let them know if your child typically:

wants to use the toilet before settling

wants a drink of water or milk

feels scared of the dark

has night terrors or sleepwalks

calls out or wants to get out of bed

wets the bed.

Managing your feelings when your child is sleeping away from home

You might feel excited about having your child sleep away from home without you if you’re having a special night out or returning to work. It’s also natural to feel anxious.

If your child is sleeping away from home at child care, talking to your child’s educator regularly can help you manage your worries. It’s also OK to call your child care service to check how your child is settling for sleep. Most centres welcome this, and it can help to ease your mind.

If your child is sleeping at a relative’s or friend’s house, you can call before bed to check how your child is going. Or you could call in the morning to find out how your child has slept."
bedtime-routines,"Bedtime routines: what they are and how they help

A bedtime routine is when your child does similar activities in roughly the same order each night before they go to sleep.

The activities in a good bedtime routine help your child fall asleep more easily at bedtime. Without a good bedtime routine, it can be hard for babies, children and teenagers to settle to sleep.

Bedtime routines change and become more flexible as your child gets older. But all children and teenagers – and adults too – benefit from calming, relaxing activities before or at bedtime. This helps them get the sleep they need to play, learn and concentrate during the day.

Positive bedtime routines for babies, toddlers and preschoolers

A positive bedtime routine for babies, toddlers and young children helps soothe and calm your child so they’re ready for sleep. It might start around 20 minutes before your child’s bedtime and include:

pre-bed tasks, like having a bath and brushing teeth

quiet, enjoyable activities with you, like reading or listening to a story.

Here’s an example of a bedtime routine that could start after dinner and a bath:
- Your child plays quietly for 15-20 minutes – for example, playing with toys, playing a game with you or listening to music.
- You and your child share a story. This might happen in a comfortable chair somewhere quiet, or you could put your child to bed and read in bed with them.
- If your child isn’t already in bed, you put your child to bed.
- You and your child have a cuddle and a kiss goodnight.
- When the routine is finished, you let your child know that it’s time for sleep. This means no more stories or talking. Say goodnight to your child, turn out the light and leave the room.

It’s a good idea to keep your child’s bedtime routine and bedtime at around the same time each night. This will also help your child feel ready for sleep.

It can take a few weeks, but a positive bedtime routine will improve settling problems, decrease the number of times your child calls out to you at night, and lead to better parent-child relationships.

Positive bedtime routines for school-age children

Bedtime routines help school-age children fall asleep. At this age, your child might be more independent with things like brushing their teeth, but they’ll probably still enjoy quiet play, reading, gentle chat and cuddles with you as part of their bedtime routine.

Even as your child becomes more independent or starts to have a later bedtime, it’s still a good idea for them to have a bedtime routine.

Here’s an example of a bedtime routine for a school-age child:

Your child does homework before dinner if they can, so that they can relax before bed.

Your child has a bath or shower.

Your child spends time doing relaxing things like drawing, listening to music or playing a game. Your child is likely to get to sleep more quickly if they avoid screens in the hour before bed.

You and your child share a story in bed. You can read to your child or ask your child to read to you.

You and your child have a cuddle and a kiss goodnight.

You or your child turns out the light.

Bedtime routines for pre-teens and teenagers

As your child gets older, their bedtime routines will need to be more flexible. For example, your child might go to bed later some nights because they have a part-time job, do after-school activities or are hanging out with friends.

It can still help older children to do the same things in the same order before they sleep each night – for example, logging off social media and turning off digital technology, having a shower, listening to music or reading, and turning out the light. You can encourage your child to work out what helps them feel relaxed and ready for sleep."
sleep-better-tips,"About good sleep for children and teenagers

A good night’s sleep is about getting to sleep, staying asleep and waking up feeling refreshed in the morning.

Getting to sleep

Most children fall asleep within 20 minutes of going to bed. How long it takes children to get to sleep can depend on how sleepy their bodies are. Also, daytime and bedtime routines can affect when children get to sleep. Bedtime routines help children wind down before bedtime, so they can fall asleep more easily.

Staying asleep

Children wake briefly during the night, but they might not be aware of being awake. To stay asleep, children need to be able to fall back to sleep by themselves after these brief waking episodes.

Waking up feeling refreshed

Most children wake up by themselves in the morning if they’re getting enough good-quality sleep.

How to sleep better for children and teenagers: tips

1. Set up a bedtime routine

A regular bedtime routine starting around the same time each night encourages good sleep patterns. A bedtime routine of bath, story and bed can help younger children feel ready for sleep. For older children and teenagers, the routine might include quietly chatting with you, turning off digital technology, having a shower, listening to music or reading, and turning out the light.

2. Relax before bedtime

Encourage your child to relax before bedtime. Older children might like to wind down by reading a book, listening to gentle music or practising breathing for relaxation. If your child takes longer than 30 minutes to fall asleep, your child might need a longer wind-down time before turning out the lights to go to sleep.

3. Keep regular sleep and wake times

Keep your child’s bedtimes and wake-up times within 1-2 hours of each other each day. This helps to keep your child’s internal body clock in a regular pattern. It’s good to do this on weekends and during holidays, as well as on school days.

4. Keep older children’s naps early and short

Most children stop napping at 3-5 years of age. If your child is having bedtime struggles at night, try to keep the nap to no longer than 20 minutes and no later than early afternoon. Longer and later naps can make it harder for children to get to sleep at night.

5. Make sure your child feels safe at night

If your child feels scared about going to bed or being in the dark, you can praise and reward your child whenever they’re brave. Avoiding scary TV shows, movies and computer games can help too. Some children with bedtime fears feel better when they have a night light.

6. Check noise and light in your child’s bedroom

Check whether your child’s bedroom is too light or noisy for sleep. Blue light from televisions, computer screens, phones and tablets suppresses melatonin levels and delays sleepiness. Bright light in the hour before bedtime can have the same effect on young children.

Try these tips:
- Turn off devices at least one hour before bedtime.
- Keep digital technology out of your child’s room at night.
- Dim the lights an hour before bed for children of preschool age and younger.

If your child uses a night-light, choose a dim, warm-coloured globe, rather than a bright, white, cool-coloured globe.

7. Avoid the clock

If your child is checking the time often, encourage your child to move the clock or watch to a spot where they can’t see it from bed.

8. Eat the right amount at the right time

Make sure your child has a satisfying evening meal at a reasonable time. Feeling hungry or too full before bed can make your child more alert or uncomfortable. This can make it harder for your child to get to sleep. In the morning, a healthy breakfast helps to kick-start your child’s body clock at the right time.

9. Get plenty of natural light in the day

Encourage your child to get as much natural light as possible during the day, especially in the morning. Bright light suppresses melatonin. This helps your child feel awake and alert during the day and sleepy towards bedtime.

10. Avoid caffeine

Caffeine is in energy drinks, coffee, tea, chocolate and cola. Encourage your child to avoid these things in the late afternoon and evening, and don’t offer them at these times.

When worries affect sleep

If childhood worries and anxieties or teenage anxieties are stopping your child from relaxing at bedtime, there are a couple of things you can do.

If there’s a quick and easy answer to your child’s problem, you can deal with it straight away. For example, ‘Yes, you can have Emma over to play on the weekend even though Grandma is staying with us’.

But if the problem needs more time, it’s probably best to acknowledge your child’s feelings and gently plan to sort things out in the morning. For example, ‘I understand that you’re worried about whether you can swim 50 metres at the swimming carnival next week. Let’s talk about it in the morning and work out what to do’.

Breathing exercises or muscle relaxation techniques can help older children focus on their physical body and calm their thoughts."
cot-to-bed,"From cot to bed

Most children move from cot to bed when they’re between 2 and 3 years old.

There’s no hurry, though. And there are advantages to leaving your child in a cot if they’re happy there. For example, your child can’t fall out of the cot. And you can put off the cost of buying a new bed and bedding for a while longer.

It's also best to wait until your child is emotionally ready to move to a bed and physically able to get in and out of the bed safely.

Sometimes the shift to a bed brings new bedtime challenges, so you might want to make the move when you’re best able to deal with these.

Why children might move from cot to bed

It might be time for your child to move to a bed if they:

have started climbing out of the cot, which puts them at risk of falling

are toilet training and need to be able to get to the toilet easily during the night.

It might also be time if you:
- have a new baby who needs the cot
- have decided to move your child out of your bed and into their own bed.

If you need advice, talk with your child and family health nurse.

Making the bedroom safe

When children move from a cot into a bed, they can get out of bed and move around their bedrooms more easily.

A safety check will help to prevent accidents. For example:

Install safety locks on windows, so the window can be opened only a little. Make sure the gap isn’t big enough for your child to climb through.

Wrap curtain and blind cords around cleats attached to the wall at least 1.6 m above the floor. Keep hanging mobiles out of your child’s reach. These things are strangulation hazards.

Use powerpoint covers. Ensure electrical appliances like heaters meet Australian safety standards. If your child isn’t safe around electrical appliances like heaters or vaporisers during the day, keep these things out of the bedroom at night. This will help to prevent your child from tripping or getting burned or electrocuted if they get up in the night.

Attach furniture or other heavy objects to the wall with brackets so they can’t fall on your child.

Keep choking hazards and households poisons out of the bedroom – for example, massage or aromatherapy oils, medicines, cleaning fluids or small objects like small toys, batteries and coins.

Take away anything your child could climb on, like chairs and ladders.

Think about installing a safety gate in the doorway of your child’s room. Or you could shut the door at night, as long as you can still hear your child. Otherwise you’ll need to make sure the rest of the house is safe for your child as well, in case your child gets up during the night.

Choosing a bed

When you move your child from cot to bed, you have a few options:

Put a cot mattress or a single bed mattress on the floor, rather than moving your child straight into a bed. This reduces the risk of your child falling out of bed and being injured. Your child might feel safer too.

Start with a toddler bed. Toddler beds are usually the same size as cots, and some cots even convert to toddler beds. They reduce the risk of your child falling out of bed and being hurt. And you can keep using your cot mattress and bedding.

Use a single bed. An advantage of a single bed is that it’ll last a long time, although a single bed increases the risk of injury from falls.

Making a safe move from cot to bed

Whichever cot-to-bed option you choose, simple precautions and planning can help keep your child safe:

Choose a fairly firm mattress.

Keep the bed or mattress on the floor away from walls to reduce suffocation risk.

Keep pillows out of the bed for children under 2 years – pillows are a suffocation risk for young children. If your child uses a pillow, choose one that keeps your child’s head and neck in line with their back (probably 5-6 cm in height).

If you choose a single bed, use bed rails to stop your child falling out of bed.

Check the bed frame and the bed rails for gaps that your child could get stuck in. Make sure the rails and the bed frame fit tightly against the mattress. If there are a lot of gaps, a mattress on the floor is a safer option until your child is older.

Avoid having heavy blankets or quilts in the bed. Keep the area on and around the bed or mattress clean and clear of soft toys, bean bags and anything else that might suffocate your child.

If your child wears an infant sleeping bag in the cot, think about whether you’ll keep using it once they’re sleeping in a bed. There’s a higher risk of falls and injuries when children wear baby sleeping bags in bed. You could dress your child in ‘onesie’ pyjamas for warmth instead.

Helping children settle into new beds: tips

Here are tips for making a successful change from cot to bed:

Tell your child how proud you are. After all, moving into a bed is an exciting step towards being a big kid!

Tell your child all about the plans to set up the new bed – and make sure they know it’ll be fun.

Get your child to help you set up the new bed. If it seems like fun, take your child shopping to choose the bed or bedding. Let your child watch while you move the furniture in the bedroom. Children usually feel happier when they’ve had a say in the move too.

Let your child make a gradual transition to the bed if they need to. For example, you could have your child’s new bed set up ready in their room while they’re still using their cot. Or start with day naps in the bed and night-time sleeps in the cot.

Throw a party and celebrate the move to the big bed.

Using a bedtime routine to help the move from cot to bed go well: tips

Moving into a big bed can be unsettling for your child. A new bedtime routine might ease the change:

Have ‘quiet time’ before bed. Pack away toys and prepare the bedroom as a place of quiet rest, rather than somewhere exciting.

Encourage your child to climb into bed if possible. Also, when children can pull up their own bedcovers and arrange pillows the way they want, they sometimes feel more settled.

Let your child take a blanket from the old cot. This might help your child feel more secure and comfortable.

Say goodnight. Tell your child what you expect and what’s going to happen next. Say something clear and positive like, ‘It’s time to go to sleep – see you in the morning!’ This can make bedtime seem less scary.

Try a reward chart to ease your child into the new bedtime routine. Your child could get a sticker as they finish each pre-bedtime activity."
sleep-learning,"About sleep and learning

Good-quality sleep helps your child concentrate, remember things, manage their emotions and behave in positive ways. These factors help your child to be a successful learner.

Poor sleep or not enough sleep affects concentration, memory and behaviour, making it harder for your child to learn. Children who don’t sleep well are more likely to have difficulties with learning.

Concentration and sleep

Children who don’t get enough sleep have trouble concentrating during the day. If your child can’t keep their attention on what they’re trying to learn, whether it’s climbing a tree at the park or singing a song at school, it will affect their learning.

Memory and sleep

Remembering things is part of learning. If your child is tired, it’s harder for your child to remember basic things like how to spell words, how to do maths calculations, or where to find information in a book or on the internet. It’s also harder for your child to remember how to do things like playing a musical instrument.

Behaviour and sleep

Sleepy children tend to behave in challenging ways at preschool or school – and at home too. Children can also find it difficult to manage their emotions if they don’t get enough sleep.

For example, a sleepy or tired child might:

not cooperate in class

have difficulty following the teacher’s instructions

miss out on learning if the teacher is focusing on their behaviour

miss out on playing with other children if the other children don’t like their behaviour.

Children who don’t get enough sleep can also be more clumsy.

Working on sleep problems to help with learning

Many children have sleep problems.

A good place to start with sleep problems is your child’s sleep habits. Sometimes changing both daytime and night-time habits can make a big difference to your child’s sleep. For example, you might be able to adjust your child’s internal body clock with a regular bedtime routine, morning sunlight, regular exercise and a healthy diet. If these strategies don’t help to adjust your child’s body clock, it’s a good idea to talk about your child’s sleep problems with a health professional, like your GP.

It’s also worth looking at your child’s breathing during sleep. If your child often snores, stops breathing during sleep, works hard to breathe, breathes through their mouth, tosses and turns at night, or sweats a lot overnight, it might be obstructive sleep apnoea. Obstructive sleep apnoea affects the quality of a child’s sleep.

Children with low iron can have trouble settling to sleep and wake in the night. Check that your child’s diet has enough foods rich in iron.

See your GP if you think your child’s sleep problems might be related to obstructive sleep apnoea or another medical condition, or if you’re worried your child might have a persistent sleep problem."
toddler-sleep,"Toddler sleep: what you need to know

Toddlers need 11-14 hours sleep every 24 hours. Usually this is a sleep of 10-12 hours a night and a nap of 1-2 hours during the day.

Toddlers are developing fast, and their relationship with sleep changes a lot at this age. You might see behaviour that looks like sleep problems. This can include challenges like getting toddlers into bed, settling them for sleep or getting them to sleep through the night. This is one way that toddlers test boundaries and practise being independent, which is a natural part of toddler development.

Once you can spot your child’s signs of tiredness, you’ll be able to settle your child to sleep before grumpiness sets in. A positive bedtime routine will be a big help with many toddler settling and sleep concerns.

Toddler sleep schedule

A common daily sleep schedule for toddlers might look like this:

7 am: wake up.
1 pm: have a nap of no more than 2 hours.
3 pm: wake up.
7.30 pm: get into bed and say goodnight.
If your toddler’s day nap is too long or too late in the day, they might not be ready for bed until late at night.

Some toddlers like to wake at 5.30 am or 6 am. There isn’t much you can do about this. Putting your toddler to bed later at night in the hope that they’ll wake later in the morning doesn’t tend to work. Your toddler might still wake up early then be grumpy from too little sleep.

If you live with an early riser, you might want to make your bedtime earlier too.

Toddler bedtime routine

A positive bedtime routine helps toddlers feel ready for sleep and settle more easily when they wake at night.

Most toddlers are ready for bed between 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm. This is a good time, because they sleep deepest between 8 pm and midnight. It’s important to keep the routine consistent on weekends as well as during the week.

A bedtime routine might look something like this:

7 pm: brush teeth and change nappy.
7.15 pm: have quiet time (read a book or tell a story).
7.30 pm: get into bed and say goodnight.
Before you turn out the light, it’s a good idea to do a quick check of your child’s room to make sure the sleeping environment is safe.

If your child takes a dummy to bed, you might consider encouraging your child to let go of the dummy.

Taking a bottle of milk to bed isn’t a good idea, because it can cause tooth decay and lead to more problems with sleep. It’s better for your child to finish their milk at least 30 minutes before going to bed.

Calling out and getting up after bedtime

Your toddler might go through a stage of calling out or getting out of bed after you’ve said goodnight.

Try these tips:

Avoid boisterous play before bedtime. This can make it harder for your child to settle.
Turn off the TV, computers and tablets an hour before bedtime, and avoid letting your child watch scary or exciting things close to bedtime.
Set up a consistent, calming bedtime routine.
Before leaving your child’s bedroom, check that your child has everything they need. Remind your child to stay quietly in bed.
If your toddler shares a bedroom with a brother or sister, you might need to delay your other child’s bedtime by half an hour until your toddler is settled and asleep. If you’re firm and consistent, your toddler will quickly get the message that bedtime is for sleeping.

Check whether your child actually needs something when they call out. If your child has done a poo, change the nappy with the lights dim and no talking. If your child is scared of the dark, think about using a night-light.

Toddler naps

At 12 months, your toddler might be having 2 naps a day, but by 3 years, they’re likely to have just 1 nap or to have dropped their daytime sleep altogether. You might find the first nap gets longer and later in the day as the second nap gradually stops.

You can encourage your toddler to nap by having a quiet, consistent pre-nap routine. For example, you could sing a gentle song, have a cuddle or read a story before naps. It’s also good to make sure your toddler has daytime naps in their cot or bed. And if your toddler stops sleeping at nap time, you could try giving your toddler a rest at the same time each day.

Night terrors

Your child might be having a night terror if they get very distressed during the night but won’t respond to comforting or soothing. Stay calm and avoid waking or touching your child unless they’re at risk of hurting themselves. Night terrors can be distressing to watch, but they don’t harm your child, and your child won’t remember them in the morning.

If you’re worried about your child’s health or wellbeing or the night terrors seem prolonged or violent, see your GP or paediatrician.

Night terrors are different from nightmares. Nightmares tend to happen in older children. After a nightmare your child might be distressed, but they’re awake and you can usually comfort them. They might remember the nightmare and still feel upset in the morning.

Moving to a ‘big bed’

Most children move from a cot to a bed when they’re around 2-3 years old. But there’s no hurry, particularly because some young toddlers might try to get out of a big bed more often.

You might need to move your child if they’ve started climbing out of the cot or need to use the potty at night. Or you might need the cot for a new baby.

Teeth-grinding

Many children grind their teeth at some stage. Children won’t usually be woken up by the sound of their own teeth-grinding – but other people in the room might be! Teeth-grinding doesn’t usually cause any damage to children’s teeth.

Getting help

Sleep medications aren’t usually the solution to children’s sleep problems. There are better ways to deal with these difficulties. If you have concerns, see your GP or paediatrician."
responsive-settling-at-6-18-months-reducing-settling-help,"Responsive settling and reducing settling help at 6-18 months

Responsive settling is responding to your child’s need for comfort at the same time as you help them fall asleep. For example, responsive settling might involve rocking or patting your child to help them settle. Or it might involve sitting with your child and comforting them with your voice while they’re settling.

Responsive settling gives your child the sense of safety and security they need to develop well. That’s because your child knows you’re close by to comfort them if they’re upset, just like you do when they’re awake during the day.

At 6-9 months, you can also start to gradually and gently reduce the responsive settling help you give your child to settle to sleep.

When you reduce settling help, your child is likely to fall asleep sooner. Your child might also be more likely to fall back to sleep without your help when they wake in the night. This is good for your baby and good for you, because it helps you both get the sleep you need.

Reducing responsive settling help for older babies and toddlers: getting started

If you want to reduce the settling help you give your baby or toddler, it’s worth setting up a positive bedtime routine first. A positive bedtime routine involves a few quiet, enjoyable activities about 20 minutes before bedtime. This helps soothe and calm your child so they’re ready to settle. Child health professionals almost always recommend you use a positive bedtime routine when you’re changing something about the way your baby or toddler sleeps.

When you’re ready to start, these tips can help things go well each bedtime:

Look for tired signs. Babies and toddlers will settle better if they’re tired.
Meet your child’s other needs before you start settling them – for example, feed baby, change their nappy, and give them a cuddle.
Ensure your child’s room is calm and comfortable. A dim and quiet environment can help too.

How to reduce responsive settling help for older babies and toddlers

You can reduce the responsive settling help you give your child by moving from your current method of settling to gradually less intensive methods. This gentle approach helps your child more easily learn new ways to settle.

Work out how your baby likes to sleep now
Think about how your baby likes to go to sleep now – for example, being fed to sleep. If you’re settling your baby by walking them in the pram, driving them in the car or co-sleeping, you can start by using settling in arms, hands-on settling or verbal reassurance. These ways to settle are explained in Responsive settling at 0-6 months.

Reduce the help you give
When you’re ready, you can gradually and gently reduce the amount of help you give your child to settle. This means waiting until your child falls asleep easily one way before you move to a less intensive way.

For example:

If you’re feeding your child to sleep, feed them until they’re drowsy but not asleep. Move from this to rocking your child to sleep in your arms.
If you’re rocking your child to sleep in your arms, rock them until they’re drowsy. Move from this to using hands-on settling in the cot.
If you use hand-on settling until your child is asleep, slow or stop the patting or rocking when they’re drowsy. Move to leaving the room while your child is drowsy but awake.
3. Leave the room while your child is still awake
Once your child is used to falling asleep in the cot without feeding, rocking or hands-on settling, you can try leaving the room while your baby is still awake. Or you might need to gradually get your baby or toddler used to falling asleep without you in the room.

If your child doesn’t settle
If your child gets very upset while you’re reducing the amount of responsive settling help you’re giving them, it’s OK to stop and give them a cuddle. When your child calms down, you can keep settling them.

If your child still can’t settle, comfort your child and settle them in whatever way works for both of you. You can give your child more practice with the new way of settling at the next bedtime.

Staying with your child to calm them helps your child more quickly and easily learn new ways to settle.

Reassuring older babies and toddlers as they settle

If your baby grizzles when you first put them to bed or after waking in the night, you could gently say ‘I’m here. Time to sleep’ or make ‘sh, sh’ sounds. You could even sing or hum a few words of a favourite song.

If your toddler calls out to you after bedtime, you can quietly respond in a similar way.

But if your baby or toddler starts crying, you need to help them settle. For example, you could calm them down with a cuddle, settle them to sleep in your arms or use hands-on settling. You can read about other ways to respond when your toddler calls out or gets out of bed."
light-noise,"Light and sleep

A darker room means less stimulation around your child. This can help calm and settle them. A darkened room also tells your child that it’s time for rest.

Once your child is in bed, they might sleep better if the amount of light in the room stays the same while they’re asleep.

Noise and sleep

Some children can settle for sleep and stay asleep with a little bit of background noise. Others prefer a quiet environment. And children often wake up easily to sudden noises or to changes in the amount of background noise.

It might be easier for your child to go to sleep and stay asleep when noise levels are kept consistent.

Tips for managing light and noise

These tips can help you reduce light and keep noise consistent in your child’s sleep environment:

Block out sudden noises. You could close the windows and doors, hang heavier curtains or a blanket over windows, and/or put a draft blocker under the door.

Block out morning light and noise with closed windows and doors, window coverings and so on. If your child can’t hear the sounds of traffic or other early risers, it might help your child sleep longer in the morning.

Try low-level noise in the room where your child sleeps. Soft music can help children fall asleep. White noise or rain sounds might soothe your child if they wake easily. These can also block out sudden noises.

Try dimming the lights as you get your baby or young child ready for bed. In the daytime, closing blinds or curtains will help your child sleep."
help-with-sleep-settling,"Why you might need help with baby sleep and toddler sleep

Babies and children need sleep to grow and develop well. Good sleep is also important for their health and immunity.

So if your baby isn’t settling or sleeping well, your baby might not be getting the sleep they need for health and development.

You’re probably not getting enough sleep either. You need sleep for your health and wellbeing. And your child is more likely to grow, develop and thrive when you’re physically, emotionally and mentally well.

That’s why it’s a good idea to get help for your baby’s sleep, if you need it.

Who can help you with baby sleep and toddler sleep

To get help with your baby’s sleep, you can talk to:

child and family health nurses

GPs

paediatricians, particularly those who specialise in child and baby sleep

some child and family psychologists.

How professionals can help with baby sleep and toddler sleep

First, the professional will talk with you to understand your concerns and your family’s needs. A good professional always finds out what your goals are for your child and your family – there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution.

The professional will ask you about your baby, your baby’s sleep, and the things you’ve tried so far. It can help to keep a diary of your baby’s sleep patterns and bring this when you see the professional.

The professional will then work with you to develop a baby sleep plan. They should help you put the plan into action and give you a copy of the plan so you can refer to it at home.

A good plan suits your baby’s needs and your family’s circumstances and cultural beliefs. It should cover:

good bedtime and sleep habits

positive bedtime routines

settling strategies that you’re comfortable using

things to try if the strategies in your baby sleep plan aren’t working.

Where to get help with baby sleep and toddler sleep

Child and family health centres

Your local child and family health centre is a good place to start. Your child and family health nurse can give you information and advice on your baby’s sleep and other early childhood concerns. Check our local services guides to find your nearest centre.

Parent helplines

Parenting helplines around Australia can help – and some are available after hours if you need help straight away. They can give you ideas about how to handle baby sleep concerns and tell you where to get help in your local area. Some helplines specialise in helping parents with babies and young children.

Early parenting centres

Early parenting centres – sometimes called ‘sleep schools’ – can help you learn to manage your baby’s sleep better. They can also give you help with settling, feeding and play routines for your baby or toddler, as well as supporting you with personal issues too.

Staff at early parenting centres understand what you and your baby are going through. They’re used to dealing with all kinds of feeding and settling problems. Different centres operate differently, but they’ll all work with you to develop a routine that encourages your baby to spend more time sleeping and less time crying.

When you call a centre, someone will speak to you about your needs and let you know what they can offer. This might be:

advice

referral to a parent education session

a day-stay program

a residential program.

If you go into a residential program, you’ll stay in a family unit with beds, a cot and everything you need, including in-house support. There might be a waiting list at some centres.

Most government parenting centres are free, because Medicare covers the cost. You might have to pay extra for things like nappies and meals.

Private centres offer the same service, but Medicare doesn’t cover the full cost. If you have private health insurance, you might be able to get some money back from your fund.

Your child and family health centre can tell you more about local parenting centres.

GP or paediatrician

Some babies and children are very difficult to settle and to get to sleep, no matter what you try. If this sounds like your situation, your baby might also benefit from seeing a paediatrician, particularly one who specialises in sleep and settling in babies and children. You could start by talking to your GP. They can refer you to a paediatrician and also check for any health or developmental concerns.

Working on baby and toddler sleep problems at home

The child health professionals you talk to at early parenting centres, child and family health centres, and helplines will have plenty of strategies for you to try at home. As you start putting these strategies into practice, it can help to keep the following points in mind:

Be patient. It takes time to get used to new routines, and your baby might cry more or be more difficult to settle initially. Make a plan with the professional for how long you’ll try something before deciding that it isn’t working and trying something else.

Be consistent. Do your best to stick to the plan for your baby. Your baby will adapt better to changes in their sleep and settling habits if you’re consistent.

Keep your baby’s sleep plan handy. Reading your baby’s sleep plan again will remind you of what you need to do. When things aren’t working, you can double-check to see whether you’re following the strategies correctly. It’s OK to contact your professional again if you need help.

Try to organise back-up when you start new strategies. Find out who you can contact for help or emotional support. For example, most early parenting centres provide a telephone number for follow-up concerns. They have staff who can answer your questions.

Talk with your partner, if you have one, and make sure you agree on the plan. It’s less stressful for your family, and the plan is more likely to work when you and your partner agree."
about-sleep,"Why is sleep important?

Sleep restores children physically. It helps them learn and remember things, and it boosts immunity. And sleep helps children grow. For example, children’s bodies produce growth hormone when they’re asleep.

Children of all ages need to get enough sleep so they can play, learn and concentrate during the day.

Sleep at different ages

Babies, children and teenagers need different amounts of sleep. For example, as babies and children get older, the amount of sleep they need slowly decreases.

Also, sleep patterns change as babies and children get older. For example, as babies get older, they begin to sleep less during the day and more at night.

Babies under 6 months: when and how much they sleep

Newborns

Newborns sleep on and off during the day and night. They sleep for 14-17 hours in every 24 hours.

They have 2 different kinds of sleep – active sleep and quiet sleep. In active sleep your baby moves around. You might see jerking, twitching or sucking. In quiet sleep your baby is still and breathing evenly.

Newborns move through active and quiet sleep in cycles that last about 40 minutes. They might wake up after a sleep cycle and need help getting back to sleep.

Babies 3-6 months

By 3 months, babies start to develop night and day sleep patterns, and they tend to start sleeping more during the night. Babies usually sleep for 12-15 hours in every 24 hours.

At 3-6 months, babies might start moving towards a pattern of 2-3 daytime sleeps of up to 2 hours each. They often wake at least once overnight.

Babies 6-12 months: when and how much they sleep

Sleep during the night

As babies develop, more of their sleep happens at night.

At this age, most babies are ready for bed between 6 pm and 10 pm. They usually take less than 40 minutes to get to sleep, but about 1 in 10 babies takes longer.

Babies might be having long sleeps of 6 hours at night by the time they’re 6 months old.

Almost two-thirds of babies wake only once during the night and need an adult to settle them back to sleep. About 1 in 10 babies calls out 3-4 times a night.

More than a third of parents say their babies have problems with sleep at this age.

Sleep during the day

Most babies aged 6-12 months still have 1-2 daytime naps. These naps usually last 30 minutes to 2 hours.

Toddlers: when and how much they sleep

Toddlers need 11-14 hours of sleep every 24 hours. Usually this is a sleep of 10-12 hours a night, and a nap of 1-2 hours during the day.

Some toddlers aren’t keen on going to bed at night. Often this is because they’d like to stay up with the family. This is the most common sleep problem reported by parents. It peaks around 18 months and improves with age.

Less than 5% of 2-year-olds wake 3 or more times overnight.

Preschoolers: when and how much they sleep

Children aged 3-5 years need 10-13 hours of sleep a night.

Some preschoolers might also have day naps that last for about an hour. When preschoolers get enough sleep overnight, they won’t need these naps anymore.

School-age children: when and how much they sleep

Children aged 5-11 years need 9-11 hours of sleep a night.

Children over 5 years of age rarely nap during the day. If your child often needs daytime naps, it’s good to check they’re getting enough sleep overnight. See your GP if you have concerns.

Primary school-age children are usually tired after school and might look forward to bedtime from about 7.30 pm.

Teenagers: when and how much they sleep

Children entering puberty generally need about 8-10 hours of sleep a night.

Changes to the circadian rhythm during adolescence mean it’s normal for teenagers to want to go to bed later at night – often around 11 pm or later – then get up later in the morning. Good daytime habits and sleep environment habits can help teenagers get enough sleep.

About sleep cycles

We all cycle between different types of sleep during the night and during long naps.

From about 6 months of age, a sleep cycle contains:

rapid eye movement (REM) sleep

non-REM sleep.

In REM sleep, your eyeballs flicker from side to side underneath your eyelids. REM sleep is also called dream sleep.

Non-REM sleep consists of deep sleep and light sleep. It’s harder to wake children who are in deep sleep, whereas children in light sleep wake up easily.

The amount of REM and non-REM sleep in a cycle changes throughout the night.

It’s also common to wake briefly between sleep cycles.

How sleep cycles affect children’s sleep

Children have a lot of deep non-REM sleep in the first few hours after they fall asleep. That’s why children sleep so soundly in the first few hours after they’ve gone to bed and are rarely disturbed by anything.

Children have more REM sleep and light non-REM sleep in the second half of the night. Children wake more easily from these kinds of sleep, so they might wake up more during this time than at the beginning of the night.

In the early childhood years, sleep cycles get longer as children get older. In children aged 3 years, sleep cycles are about 60 minutes. By about 5 years, sleep cycles have matured to the adult length of about 90 minutes."
sleep-travelling,"Balancing travel, flexibility and children’s sleep

Family holidays and family travel can affect when children sleep and how much sleep they get.

It’s great to be flexible with your usual routines while you’re travelling or on holidays. But your child still needs to get enough sleep. When your child is well rested, they’ll be better able to handle time away from home. They’ll also be ready to enjoy family activities.

There are a few things you can do to balance travel and flexibility with your child’s sleep needs.

Sleeping on car, bus, train and plane trips

It can help to plan car, bus, train or plane trips around your child’s sleep or rest time. This way, your child can sleep, and the trip might be easier for you too.

For babies and toddlers, starting a trip at nap time can work well. You can increase the chances of your child going to sleep and staying asleep by making sure they have a clean nappy and have recently had a feed.

For active preschoolers and school-age children, starting a trip after your child has had some time to play outside can help your child settle down when you begin the trip. It’s a good idea for your child to go to the toilet before you set off. And you might like to give your child a snack before you leave.

Sleeping in unfamiliar places

It’s natural for children to feel unsettled when they’re sleeping in unfamiliar places.

Here are a few tips that can help for babies:

Make sure your baby sleeps in a separate, safe environment like at home.

Follow your usual bedtime routines – for example, breastfeed, read a story, have a cuddle and say good night.

Use your baby’s familiar sleeping bag or suit, if they have one.

Keep a low light on if your baby is used to this.

Give extra comfort and reassurance if your baby needs it – for example, you could try a responsive settling method.

And here are a few tips that can help for children:

Avoid giving your child a heavy meal just before bedtime.

Make sure your child knows that you’re nearby. Show them where you’re sleeping before they go to bed.

Follow your usual bedtime routines – for example, brush teeth, read a story, have a cuddle and say good night.

Give your child their favourite toy or blanket.

Dress your child in pyjamas that they’re used to. Older children might like dressing in new ‘holiday pyjamas’.

Keep a low light on so that your child can work out where they are if they wake in the night.

If your child calls out in the night, give them extra cuddles or reassurance if they need it.

Sleeping in different time zones

If you’re travelling with children in the same time zone, you can help your child get the sleep they need by trying to stick to their usual sleep routine.

But if you’re travelling in different time zones, you and your child might be affected by jet lag. This is when your internal body clock for sleeping, eating and waking doesn’t match night and day in the time zone you’ve travelled to. Babies and young children usually aren’t as affected by jet lag as adults, but they might be tired and grumpy and not want to sleep at their usual nap times or bedtime.

A good tip is to plan for different time zones. Before you go, try changing mealtimes, bedtimes and wake times towards new time zones. This will help you and your child adjust more quickly when you get there. Once you’ve arrived, it can help to get outside in daylight and take short daytime naps when you or your child feels sleepy."
sleep-problems-solutions,"About sleep problems and solutions in children and teenagers

All children can sometimes have trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep. Children’s problems with sleep might be caused by or related to things like:

bedtime routines

sleep environments

unhealthy eating habits

lack of physical activity

illnesses, health conditions or anxiety.

Sometimes sleep behaviour can look like a problem, but it’s actually a common part of development. This includes:

night terrors, nightmares and sleepwalking

bedwetting and toileting.

Bedtime routine

Too much noise, activity or screen use before bed can get children overexcited and make it harder for them to settle down for sleep. You can work on this with a bedtime routine that includes up to an hour of quiet time. This will help your child wind down for sleep.

Sometimes changes to children’s normal bedtime routine can affect how well they settle down – for example, daylight saving, jet lag or a new bedroom. These sleep problems usually sort themselves out within a week or so, as your child’s sleep cycle adjusts to a new routine.

Sleep environment

Some sleep environments can make it harder for children to get to sleep.

A comfortable environment for sleep is usually quiet, dimly lit and neither too hot nor too cold.

Eating habits

What and when your child eats and drinks can affect their ability to settle down at night.

Here are some ideas if you think your child’s eating habits during the day might be causing sleep problems:

Make sure your child avoids caffeine – for example, in energy drinks, coffee, tea, chocolate and cola – especially after about 3 pm.

Make sure your child has a satisfying evening meal at a reasonable time. Feeling hungry or too full before bed can make it harder for your child to get to sleep.

Physical activity

If your child isn’t doing enough physical activity during the day, they might not be feeling physically tired enough to settle down for sleep at night.

It’s a good idea to encourage your child to be more active during the day. Even a family walk before dinner can make a difference.

It’s great if your child can be active outside, because plenty of natural light during the day also helps with sleep.

Common childhood illnesses

Common childhood illnesses like colds or ear infections can sometimes make it hard for children to settle or sleep well. This is normal.

But if your child has been sick, you’ve probably been getting up in the night to soothe and settle them. Once your child is better, they might like to keep having that extra night-time attention. If this sounds like your situation, you might need to be firm about getting back into your child’s normal bedtime routine.

Chronic health conditions

Chronic health conditions like asthma or epilepsy can also affect children’s sleep.

It’s a good idea to talk with your child’s GP if your child has sleep problems and a chronic condition.

Worries and anxiety

If your child is worried about something, they might find it hard to get to sleep or get back to sleep if they wake in the night.

You can deal with some worries straight away. For example, ‘Yes, you can have Isla over to play on the weekend even though Grandma is staying with us’.

Other worries will need more time and talk. For example, if your child is worried about doing a speech in front of the class, you could set aside time after school to listen to your child and work together on solutions.

Big problems like bullying can worry your child and affect their sleep over a longer period. If your child knows what you’re doing to work on the problem, it might help them sleep better. During the day, tell your child how you plan to help, and remind them again if they start to worry at bedtime.

Anxiety can affect children’s sleep too. And if your child is sleeping poorly, this can make their anxiety worse. You might consider seeing your GP or another health professional if your child’s anxiety seems unusually severe.

Night terrors, nightmares and sleepwalking

If your child sometimes wakes up screaming or crying, it could be a night terror or a nightmare. Some children might also sleepwalk.

Although night terrors, nightmares and sleepwalking are all typical aspects of development, it’s best to talk to your child’s GP if you’re worried or if your child’s behaviour seems severe.

Bedwetting and toileting

Your child might wake because they’re wetting the bed. Or they might wake to go to the toilet and then find it hard to get back to sleep.

You can talk with the GP if toilet training and bedwetting are problems for your child.

Getting help for sleep problems in children and teenagers

Talk with your child’s GP if you’ve been trying good sleep habits and lifestyle changes, and they don’t seem to be helping. You might be referred to a paediatrician, psychologist or other health professional who’s experienced in treating children’s persistent sleep problems. You can also go to Australian Psychological Society – Find a psychologist to look for psychologists with expertise in sleep problems.

Medicine

Although medicine isn’t the best solution to sleep problems, it can help in some extreme cases. You should give your child sleep medicine only if your doctor advises you to do so and only if the doctor is supervising your child’s treatment."
teeth-grinding,"About teeth-grinding or bruxism

Many children grind their teeth at some stage. Some children clench their jaws quite firmly. Others grind so hard that it makes a noise.

Children who grind their teeth at night won’t usually wake up because of the noise they’re making – but other people in the room might!

Teeth-grinding is also called bruxism.

When to seek help for teeth-grinding

If you’re worried about your child’s teeth-grinding, talk to a health professional, like your GP or dentist. Devices to protect teeth or prevent grinding can help. You can talk to your dentist about these.

If your child grinds their teeth and also snores loudly, breathes with their mouth open, or chokes or gasps while they’re asleep, it’s a good idea to see your GP. This can help you rule out issues like sleep apnoea.

Why children grind their teeth

Nobody knows for sure why children grind their teeth.

They might do it because:

Their top and bottom teeth aren’t lined up.

They have pain somewhere else in their bodies.

They’re stressed.

Some children grind their teeth during the day because they enjoy the feeling.

In most cases, it’s likely to be just a childhood habit that children grow out of."
toddlers_sleep,"night-weaning,""Night feeding: what to expect

It’s common for babies to wake at night during the first year of life. They wake to feed, and they also wake for comfort.

As babies get older, they usually wake less often at night to feed.

Thinking about night weaning and phasing out night feeds?

If you’re comfortable with feeding your child during the night, there’s no hurry to phase out night feeds. You can choose what works best for you and your child.

Before you decide to night wean or phase out night feeds, it’s a good idea to talk with your child and family health nurse or GP to get advice that suits your individual situation.

Night weaning breastfed children

It’s OK to think about night weaning for healthy breastfed children from 12 months of age.

At this age, most children are getting enough food during the day for their growth and development. But before 12 months, night weaning breastfed babies can reduce your milk supply.

Here’s how to get started with night weaning for breastfed children.

Short night feed

If your child’s night feed is short (less than 5 minutes), you can phase out night feeds by stopping the feed altogether and re-settling your child using sleep and settling techniques that work best for you and your baby. Note that it might take several nights for you and your child to get used to the new routine.

Longer night-time feed

If your child’s night feed is usually longer than 5 minutes, you can gradually cut down the time you spend feeding over 5-7 nights. This will help your child get used to the change. Here’s how:

Reduce the time your child feeds by 2-5 minutes every second night. For example, if your child usually feeds for 10 minutes, feed for 8 minutes for 2 nights, then 6 minutes for the next 2 nights, and so on.

Re-settle your child after each shortened feed with the settling techniques of your choice.

Follow your child’s lead. If your child becomes very distressed, you might stop weaning for a while.

Things to keep in mind

If you decide to try night weaning, your child still gets all the benefits of breastmilk if you keep breastfeeding during the day.

Your child might want to feed more for comfort when big changes are happening. For example, they might need more comfort if they’re starting child care.

If your child needs night-time comfort but not night feeds, your partner (if you have one) could settle your child at night.

Phasing out night feeds for formula-fed babies

For formula-fed babies, you can think about phasing out night feeds from 6 months of age.

If your baby is formula fed and aged over 6 months, they’re unlikely to be waking at night because they’re hungry. This is because infant formula is digested more slowly than breastmilk.

Night-time feed of 60 ml of milk or less

If you decide to try phasing out night feeds and your baby is having 60 ml of milk or less during a night feed, you can stop the feed altogether and re-settle your baby with the settling techniques that work best for you and your baby.

Night-time feed of more than 60 ml of milk

If your baby’s feed is more than 60 ml each night, you can gradually cut down the amount your baby drinks over 5-7 nights.

Here’s how:

Reduce the volume of milk by 20-30 ml every second night. For example, if your baby usually drinks 180 ml, you would give 150 ml for 2 nights, then 120 ml for the next 2 nights, and so on.

Re-settle your baby after each smaller feed with the settling techniques of your choice.

Once you get down to 60 ml or less in the bottle, stop the feed altogether.""
sleeping-away-from-home,""About sleeping away from home

At some point your child might need to sleep away from home without you.

This might be when your child goes to child care and is still having daytime naps. Or there might be times when you need to be away for work or you work late, so your child needs to sleep at a relative’s or friend’s house.

You might also be thinking about your child having a sleepover with their grandparents or other relatives so you can have a night out. Or you might want to strengthen the relationship between your child and their extended family members with a special activity like a sleepover. In this situation, it’s best to be guided by whether you think your child is ready.

Either way, it might help to know that most children learn to cope with sleeping away from home.

Preparing children to sleep away from home

If your child will be sleeping away from home without you, knowing what’s going to happen can help your child feel safer and happier.

For toddlers, it’s a good idea to explain what’s going to happen in words they can understand. For example, ‘You’re having a sleepover at Nanna’s. She’ll give you milk and a story before bed, just like we do at home. I’ll see you tomorrow’.

For preschoolers, you can give as much information as you think they can handle about:

where they’re going

who’ll be looking after them

where and when they’ll be sleeping

when you’ll be back.

The ‘What if?’ game is also a great way to prepare children for new experiences like sleeping away from home without you. For example, you could ask, ‘What will you do if you wake up during the night? That’s right, you’ll call out to Nanna’.

You can make it fun by drawing pictures of what’s going to happen or by talking about the person your child is going to visit. Seeing photos of the person or speaking with the person on the phone might also help your child. You could even do a fun camp-out in the family room at home first.

Maintaining children’s sleep routines away from home

Doing the same things away from home can help your child adapt to unfamiliar places, so sleeping away can be easier if you can maintain your child’s usual sleep routine.

If your child will be sleeping away from home at child care, it might help to know that most child care centres will try to follow children’s regular feeding, sleeping and play routines, especially for babies.

It can help if you describe your child’s sleep routine to anyone who’ll be caring for your child away from home, like grandparents, relatives, early childhood educators and carers, and so on. For example, ‘Levi likes a story before his nap’, ‘Lani’s routine is bottle-feed at 6 pm, bath at 6.30 pm, and bed at 7 pm’ or ‘Lil settles well with a quiet lullaby’.

For overnight stays, it’s a good idea to pack anything special that helps your child settle for sleep, like a teddy, blanket or favourite pair of pyjamas. If you use a night light, white noise machine or something else to control light and noise while your child is asleep, make sure you pack these too.

You can also let carers know about things your child might need during naps or at night. For example, let them know if your child typically:

wants to use the toilet before settling

wants a drink of water or milk

feels scared of the dark

has night terrors or sleepwalks

calls out or wants to get out of bed

wets the bed.

Managing your feelings when your child is sleeping away from home

You might feel excited about having your child sleep away from home without you if you’re having a special night out or returning to work. It’s also natural to feel anxious.

If your child is sleeping away from home at child care, talking to your child’s educator regularly can help you manage your worries. It’s also OK to call your child care service to check how your child is settling for sleep. Most centres welcome this, and it can help to ease your mind.

If your child is sleeping at a relative’s or friend’s house, you can call before bed to check how your child is going. Or you could call in the morning to find out how your child has slept.""
bedtime-routines,""Bedtime routines: what they are and how they help

A bedtime routine is when your child does similar activities in roughly the same order each night before they go to sleep.

The activities in a good bedtime routine help your child fall asleep more easily at bedtime. Without a good bedtime routine, it can be hard for babies, children and teenagers to settle to sleep.

Bedtime routines change and become more flexible as your child gets older. But all children and teenagers – and adults too – benefit from calming, relaxing activities before or at bedtime. This helps them get the sleep they need to play, learn and concentrate during the day.

Positive bedtime routines for babies, toddlers and preschoolers

A positive bedtime routine for babies, toddlers and young children helps soothe and calm your child so they’re ready for sleep. It might start around 20 minutes before your child’s bedtime and include:

pre-bed tasks, like having a bath and brushing teeth

quiet, enjoyable activities with you, like reading or listening to a story.

Here’s an example of a bedtime routine that could start after dinner and a bath:
- Your child plays quietly for 15-20 minutes – for example, playing with toys, playing a game with you or listening to music.
- You and your child share a story. This might happen in a comfortable chair somewhere quiet, or you could put your child to bed and read in bed with them.
- If your child isn’t already in bed, you put your child to bed.
- You and your child have a cuddle and a kiss goodnight.
- When the routine is finished, you let your child know that it’s time for sleep. This means no more stories or talking. Say goodnight to your child, turn out the light and leave the room.

It’s a good idea to keep your child’s bedtime routine and bedtime at around the same time each night. This will also help your child feel ready for sleep.

It can take a few weeks, but a positive bedtime routine will improve settling problems, decrease the number of times your child calls out to you at night, and lead to better parent-child relationships.

Positive bedtime routines for school-age children

Bedtime routines help school-age children fall asleep. At this age, your child might be more independent with things like brushing their teeth, but they’ll probably still enjoy quiet play, reading, gentle chat and cuddles with you as part of their bedtime routine.

Even as your child becomes more independent or starts to have a later bedtime, it’s still a good idea for them to have a bedtime routine.

Here’s an example of a bedtime routine for a school-age child:

Your child does homework before dinner if they can, so that they can relax before bed.

Your child has a bath or shower.

Your child spends time doing relaxing things like drawing, listening to music or playing a game. Your child is likely to get to sleep more quickly if they avoid screens in the hour before bed.

You and your child share a story in bed. You can read to your child or ask your child to read to you.

You and your child have a cuddle and a kiss goodnight.

You or your child turns out the light.

Bedtime routines for pre-teens and teenagers

As your child gets older, their bedtime routines will need to be more flexible. For example, your child might go to bed later some nights because they have a part-time job, do after-school activities or are hanging out with friends.

It can still help older children to do the same things in the same order before they sleep each night – for example, logging off social media and turning off digital technology, having a shower, listening to music or reading, and turning out the light. You can encourage your child to work out what helps them feel relaxed and ready for sleep.""
sleep-better-tips,""About good sleep for children and teenagers

A good night’s sleep is about getting to sleep, staying asleep and waking up feeling refreshed in the morning.

Getting to sleep

Most children fall asleep within 20 minutes of going to bed. How long it takes children to get to sleep can depend on how sleepy their bodies are. Also, daytime and bedtime routines can affect when children get to sleep. Bedtime routines help children wind down before bedtime, so they can fall asleep more easily.

Staying asleep

Children wake briefly during the night, but they might not be aware of being awake. To stay asleep, children need to be able to fall back to sleep by themselves after these brief waking episodes.

Waking up feeling refreshed

Most children wake up by themselves in the morning if they’re getting enough good-quality sleep.

How to sleep better for children and teenagers: tips

Set up a bedtime routine

A regular bedtime routine starting around the same time each night encourages good sleep patterns. A bedtime routine of bath, story and bed can help younger children feel ready for sleep. For older children and teenagers, the routine might include quietly chatting with you, turning off digital technology, having a shower, listening to music or reading, and turning out the light.

Relax before bedtime

Encourage your child to relax before bedtime. Older children might like to wind down by reading a book, listening to gentle music or practising breathing for relaxation. If your child takes longer than 30 minutes to fall asleep, your child might need a longer wind-down time before turning out the lights to go to sleep.

Keep regular sleep and wake times

Keep your child’s bedtimes and wake-up times within 1-2 hours of each other each day. This helps to keep your child’s internal body clock in a regular pattern. It’s good to do this on weekends and during holidays, as well as on school days.

Keep older children’s naps early and short

Most children stop napping at 3-5 years of age. If your child is having bedtime struggles at night, try to keep the nap to no longer than 20 minutes and no later than early afternoon. Longer and later naps can make it harder for children to get to sleep at night.

Make sure your child feels safe at night

If your child feels scared about going to bed or being in the dark, you can praise and reward your child whenever they’re brave. Avoiding scary TV shows, movies and computer games can help too. Some children with bedtime fears feel better when they have a night light.

Check noise and light in your child’s bedroom

Check whether your child’s bedroom is too light or noisy for sleep. Blue light from televisions, computer screens, phones and tablets suppresses melatonin levels and delays sleepiness. Bright light in the hour before bedtime can have the same effect on young children.

Try these tips:
- Turn off devices at least one hour before bedtime.
- Keep digital technology out of your child’s room at night.
- Dim the lights an hour before bed for children of preschool age and younger.

If your child uses a night-light, choose a dim, warm-coloured globe, rather than a bright, white, cool-coloured globe.

Avoid the clock

If your child is checking the time often, encourage your child to move the clock or watch to a spot where they can’t see it from bed.

Eat the right amount at the right time

Make sure your child has a satisfying evening meal at a reasonable time. Feeling hungry or too full before bed can make your child more alert or uncomfortable. This can make it harder for your child to get to sleep. In the morning, a healthy breakfast helps to kick-start your child’s body clock at the right time.

Get plenty of natural light in the day

Encourage your child to get as much natural light as possible during the day, especially in the morning. Bright light suppresses melatonin. This helps your child feel awake and alert during the day and sleepy towards bedtime.

Avoid caffeine

Caffeine is in energy drinks, coffee, tea, chocolate and cola. Encourage your child to avoid these things in the late afternoon and evening, and don’t offer them at these times.

When worries affect sleep

If childhood worries and anxieties or teenage anxieties are stopping your child from relaxing at bedtime, there are a couple of things you can do.

If there’s a quick and easy answer to your child’s problem, you can deal with it straight away. For example, ‘Yes, you can have Emma over to play on the weekend even though Grandma is staying with us’.

But if the problem needs more time, it’s probably best to acknowledge your child’s feelings and gently plan to sort things out in the morning. For example, ‘I understand that you’re worried about whether you can swim 50 metres at the swimming carnival next week. Let’s talk about it in the morning and work out what to do’.

Breathing exercises or muscle relaxation techniques can help older children focus on their physical body and calm their thoughts.""
cot-to-bed,""From cot to bed

Most children move from cot to bed when they’re between 2 and 3 years old.

There’s no hurry, though. And there are advantages to leaving your child in a cot if they’re happy there. For example, your child can’t fall out of the cot. And you can put off the cost of buying a new bed and bedding for a while longer.

It's also best to wait until your child is emotionally ready to move to a bed and physically able to get in and out of the bed safely.

Sometimes the shift to a bed brings new bedtime challenges, so you might want to make the move when you’re best able to deal with these.

Why children might move from cot to bed

It might be time for your child to move to a bed if they:

have started climbing out of the cot, which puts them at risk of falling

are toilet training and need to be able to get to the toilet easily during the night.

It might also be time if you:
- have a new baby who needs the cot
- have decided to move your child out of your bed and into their own bed.

If you need advice, talk with your child and family health nurse.

Making the bedroom safe

When children move from a cot into a bed, they can get out of bed and move around their bedrooms more easily.

A safety check will help to prevent accidents. For example:

Install safety locks on windows, so the window can be opened only a little. Make sure the gap isn’t big enough for your child to climb through.

Wrap curtain and blind cords around cleats attached to the wall at least 1.6 m above the floor. Keep hanging mobiles out of your child’s reach. These things are strangulation hazards.

Use powerpoint covers. Ensure electrical appliances like heaters meet Australian safety standards. If your child isn’t safe around electrical appliances like heaters or vaporisers during the day, keep these things out of the bedroom at night. This will help to prevent your child from tripping or getting burned or electrocuted if they get up in the night.

Attach furniture or other heavy objects to the wall with brackets so they can’t fall on your child.

Keep choking hazards and households poisons out of the bedroom – for example, massage or aromatherapy oils, medicines, cleaning fluids or small objects like small toys, batteries and coins.

Take away anything your child could climb on, like chairs and ladders.

Think about installing a safety gate in the doorway of your child’s room. Or you could shut the door at night, as long as you can still hear your child. Otherwise you’ll need to make sure the rest of the house is safe for your child as well, in case your child gets up during the night.

Choosing a bed

When you move your child from cot to bed, you have a few options:

Put a cot mattress or a single bed mattress on the floor, rather than moving your child straight into a bed. This reduces the risk of your child falling out of bed and being injured. Your child might feel safer too.

Start with a toddler bed. Toddler beds are usually the same size as cots, and some cots even convert to toddler beds. They reduce the risk of your child falling out of bed and being hurt. And you can keep using your cot mattress and bedding.

Use a single bed. An advantage of a single bed is that it’ll last a long time, although a single bed increases the risk of injury from falls.

Making a safe move from cot to bed

Whichever cot-to-bed option you choose, simple precautions and planning can help keep your child safe:

Choose a fairly firm mattress.

Keep the bed or mattress on the floor away from walls to reduce suffocation risk.

Keep pillows out of the bed for children under 2 years – pillows are a suffocation risk for young children. If your child uses a pillow, choose one that keeps your child’s head and neck in line with their back (probably 5-6 cm in height).

If you choose a single bed, use bed rails to stop your child falling out of bed.

Check the bed frame and the bed rails for gaps that your child could get stuck in. Make sure the rails and the bed frame fit tightly against the mattress. If there are a lot of gaps, a mattress on the floor is a safer option until your child is older.

Avoid having heavy blankets or quilts in the bed. Keep the area on and around the bed or mattress clean and clear of soft toys, bean bags and anything else that might suffocate your child.

If your child wears an infant sleeping bag in the cot, think about whether you’ll keep using it once they’re sleeping in a bed. There’s a higher risk of falls and injuries when children wear baby sleeping bags in bed. You could dress your child in ‘onesie’ pyjamas for warmth instead.

Helping children settle into new beds: tips

Here are tips for making a successful change from cot to bed:

Tell your child how proud you are. After all, moving into a bed is an exciting step towards being a big kid!

Tell your child all about the plans to set up the new bed – and make sure they know it’ll be fun.

Get your child to help you set up the new bed. If it seems like fun, take your child shopping to choose the bed or bedding. Let your child watch while you move the furniture in the bedroom. Children usually feel happier when they’ve had a say in the move too.

Let your child make a gradual transition to the bed if they need to. For example, you could have your child’s new bed set up ready in their room while they’re still using their cot. Or start with day naps in the bed and night-time sleeps in the cot.

Throw a party and celebrate the move to the big bed.

Using a bedtime routine to help the move from cot to bed go well: tips

Moving into a big bed can be unsettling for your child. A new bedtime routine might ease the change:

Have ‘quiet time’ before bed. Pack away toys and prepare the bedroom as a place of quiet rest, rather than somewhere exciting.

Encourage your child to climb into bed if possible. Also, when children can pull up their own bedcovers and arrange pillows the way they want, they sometimes feel more settled.

Let your child take a blanket from the old cot. This might help your child feel more secure and comfortable.

Say goodnight. Tell your child what you expect and what’s going to happen next. Say something clear and positive like, ‘It’s time to go to sleep – see you in the morning!’ This can make bedtime seem less scary.

Try a reward chart to ease your child into the new bedtime routine. Your child could get a sticker as they finish each pre-bedtime activity.""
sleep-learning,""About sleep and learning

Good-quality sleep helps your child concentrate, remember things, manage their emotions and behave in positive ways. These factors help your child to be a successful learner.

Poor sleep or not enough sleep affects concentration, memory and behaviour, making it harder for your child to learn. Children who don’t sleep well are more likely to have difficulties with learning.

Concentration and sleep

Children who don’t get enough sleep have trouble concentrating during the day. If your child can’t keep their attention on what they’re trying to learn, whether it’s climbing a tree at the park or singing a song at school, it will affect their learning.

Memory and sleep

Remembering things is part of learning. If your child is tired, it’s harder for your child to remember basic things like how to spell words, how to do maths calculations, or where to find information in a book or on the internet. It’s also harder for your child to remember how to do things like playing a musical instrument.

Behaviour and sleep

Sleepy children tend to behave in challenging ways at preschool or school – and at home too. Children can also find it difficult to manage their emotions if they don’t get enough sleep.

For example, a sleepy or tired child might:

not cooperate in class

have difficulty following the teacher’s instructions

miss out on learning if the teacher is focusing on their behaviour

miss out on playing with other children if the other children don’t like their behaviour.

Children who don’t get enough sleep can also be more clumsy.

Working on sleep problems to help with learning

Many children have sleep problems.

A good place to start with sleep problems is your child’s sleep habits. Sometimes changing both daytime and night-time habits can make a big difference to your child’s sleep. For example, you might be able to adjust your child’s internal body clock with a regular bedtime routine, morning sunlight, regular exercise and a healthy diet. If these strategies don’t help to adjust your child’s body clock, it’s a good idea to talk about your child’s sleep problems with a health professional, like your GP.

It’s also worth looking at your child’s breathing during sleep. If your child often snores, stops breathing during sleep, works hard to breathe, breathes through their mouth, tosses and turns at night, or sweats a lot overnight, it might be obstructive sleep apnoea. Obstructive sleep apnoea affects the quality of a child’s sleep.

Children with low iron can have trouble settling to sleep and wake in the night. Check that your child’s diet has enough foods rich in iron.

See your GP if you think your child’s sleep problems might be related to obstructive sleep apnoea or another medical condition, or if you’re worried your child might have a persistent sleep problem.""
toddler-sleep,""Toddler sleep: what you need to know

Toddlers need 11-14 hours sleep every 24 hours. Usually this is a sleep of 10-12 hours a night and a nap of 1-2 hours during the day.

Toddlers are developing fast, and their relationship with sleep changes a lot at this age. You might see behaviour that looks like sleep problems. This can include challenges like getting toddlers into bed, settling them for sleep or getting them to sleep through the night. This is one way that toddlers test boundaries and practise being independent, which is a natural part of toddler development.

Once you can spot your child’s signs of tiredness, you’ll be able to settle your child to sleep before grumpiness sets in. A positive bedtime routine will be a big help with many toddler settling and sleep concerns.

Toddler sleep schedule

A common daily sleep schedule for toddlers might look like this:

7 am: wake up.
1 pm: have a nap of no more than 2 hours.
3 pm: wake up.
7.30 pm: get into bed and say goodnight.
If your toddler’s day nap is too long or too late in the day, they might not be ready for bed until late at night.

Some toddlers like to wake at 5.30 am or 6 am. There isn’t much you can do about this. Putting your toddler to bed later at night in the hope that they’ll wake later in the morning doesn’t tend to work. Your toddler might still wake up early then be grumpy from too little sleep.

If you live with an early riser, you might want to make your bedtime earlier too.

Toddler bedtime routine

A positive bedtime routine helps toddlers feel ready for sleep and settle more easily when they wake at night.

Most toddlers are ready for bed between 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm. This is a good time, because they sleep deepest between 8 pm and midnight. It’s important to keep the routine consistent on weekends as well as during the week.

A bedtime routine might look something like this:

7 pm: brush teeth and change nappy.
7.15 pm: have quiet time (read a book or tell a story).
7.30 pm: get into bed and say goodnight.
Before you turn out the light, it’s a good idea to do a quick check of your child’s room to make sure the sleeping environment is safe.

If your child takes a dummy to bed, you might consider encouraging your child to let go of the dummy.

Taking a bottle of milk to bed isn’t a good idea, because it can cause tooth decay and lead to more problems with sleep. It’s better for your child to finish their milk at least 30 minutes before going to bed.

Calling out and getting up after bedtime

Your toddler might go through a stage of calling out or getting out of bed after you’ve said goodnight.

Try these tips:

Avoid boisterous play before bedtime. This can make it harder for your child to settle.
Turn off the TV, computers and tablets an hour before bedtime, and avoid letting your child watch scary or exciting things close to bedtime.
Set up a consistent, calming bedtime routine.
Before leaving your child’s bedroom, check that your child has everything they need. Remind your child to stay quietly in bed.
If your toddler shares a bedroom with a brother or sister, you might need to delay your other child’s bedtime by half an hour until your toddler is settled and asleep. If you’re firm and consistent, your toddler will quickly get the message that bedtime is for sleeping.

Check whether your child actually needs something when they call out. If your child has done a poo, change the nappy with the lights dim and no talking. If your child is scared of the dark, think about using a night-light.

Toddler naps

At 12 months, your toddler might be having 2 naps a day, but by 3 years, they’re likely to have just 1 nap or to have dropped their daytime sleep altogether. You might find the first nap gets longer and later in the day as the second nap gradually stops.

You can encourage your toddler to nap by having a quiet, consistent pre-nap routine. For example, you could sing a gentle song, have a cuddle or read a story before naps. It’s also good to make sure your toddler has daytime naps in their cot or bed. And if your toddler stops sleeping at nap time, you could try giving your toddler a rest at the same time each day.

Night terrors

Your child might be having a night terror if they get very distressed during the night but won’t respond to comforting or soothing. Stay calm and avoid waking or touching your child unless they’re at risk of hurting themselves. Night terrors can be distressing to watch, but they don’t harm your child, and your child won’t remember them in the morning.

If you’re worried about your child’s health or wellbeing or the night terrors seem prolonged or violent, see your GP or paediatrician.

Night terrors are different from nightmares. Nightmares tend to happen in older children. After a nightmare your child might be distressed, but they’re awake and you can usually comfort them. They might remember the nightmare and still feel upset in the morning.

Moving to a ‘big bed’

Most children move from a cot to a bed when they’re around 2-3 years old. But there’s no hurry, particularly because some young toddlers might try to get out of a big bed more often.

You might need to move your child if they’ve started climbing out of the cot or need to use the potty at night. Or you might need the cot for a new baby.

Teeth-grinding

Many children grind their teeth at some stage. Children won’t usually be woken up by the sound of their own teeth-grinding – but other people in the room might be! Teeth-grinding doesn’t usually cause any damage to children’s teeth.

Getting help

Sleep medications aren’t usually the solution to children’s sleep problems. There are better ways to deal with these difficulties. If you have concerns, see your GP or paediatrician.""
responsive-settling-at-6-18-months-reducing-settling-help,""Responsive settling and reducing settling help at 6-18 months

Responsive settling is responding to your child’s need for comfort at the same time as you help them fall asleep. For example, responsive settling might involve rocking or patting your child to help them settle. Or it might involve sitting with your child and comforting them with your voice while they’re settling.

Responsive settling gives your child the sense of safety and security they need to develop well. That’s because your child knows you’re close by to comfort them if they’re upset, just like you do when they’re awake during the day.

At 6-9 months, you can also start to gradually and gently reduce the responsive settling help you give your child to settle to sleep.

When you reduce settling help, your child is likely to fall asleep sooner. Your child might also be more likely to fall back to sleep without your help when they wake in the night. This is good for your baby and good for you, because it helps you both get the sleep you need.

Reducing responsive settling help for older babies and toddlers: getting started

If you want to reduce the settling help you give your baby or toddler, it’s worth setting up a positive bedtime routine first. A positive bedtime routine involves a few quiet, enjoyable activities about 20 minutes before bedtime. This helps soothe and calm your child so they’re ready to settle. Child health professionals almost always recommend you use a positive bedtime routine when you’re changing something about the way your baby or toddler sleeps.

When you’re ready to start, these tips can help things go well each bedtime:

Look for tired signs. Babies and toddlers will settle better if they’re tired.
Meet your child’s other needs before you start settling them – for example, feed baby, change their nappy, and give them a cuddle.
Ensure your child’s room is calm and comfortable. A dim and quiet environment can help too.

How to reduce responsive settling help for older babies and toddlers

You can reduce the responsive settling help you give your child by moving from your current method of settling to gradually less intensive methods. This gentle approach helps your child more easily learn new ways to settle.

Work out how your baby likes to sleep now
Think about how your baby likes to go to sleep now – for example, being fed to sleep. If you’re settling your baby by walking them in the pram, driving them in the car or co-sleeping, you can start by using settling in arms, hands-on settling or verbal reassurance. These ways to settle are explained in Responsive settling at 0-6 months.

Reduce the help you give
When you’re ready, you can gradually and gently reduce the amount of help you give your child to settle. This means waiting until your child falls asleep easily one way before you move to a less intensive way.

For example:

If you’re feeding your child to sleep, feed them until they’re drowsy but not asleep. Move from this to rocking your child to sleep in your arms.
If you’re rocking your child to sleep in your arms, rock them until they’re drowsy. Move from this to using hands-on settling in the cot.
If you use hand-on settling until your child is asleep, slow or stop the patting or rocking when they’re drowsy. Move to leaving the room while your child is drowsy but awake.
3. Leave the room while your child is still awake
Once your child is used to falling asleep in the cot without feeding, rocking or hands-on settling, you can try leaving the room while your baby is still awake. Or you might need to gradually get your baby or toddler used to falling asleep without you in the room.

If your child doesn’t settle
If your child gets very upset while you’re reducing the amount of responsive settling help you’re giving them, it’s OK to stop and give them a cuddle. When your child calms down, you can keep settling them.

If your child still can’t settle, comfort your child and settle them in whatever way works for both of you. You can give your child more practice with the new way of settling at the next bedtime.

Staying with your child to calm them helps your child more quickly and easily learn new ways to settle.

Reassuring older babies and toddlers as they settle

If your baby grizzles when you first put them to bed or after waking in the night, you could gently say ‘I’m here. Time to sleep’ or make ‘sh, sh’ sounds. You could even sing or hum a few words of a favourite song.

If your toddler calls out to you after bedtime, you can quietly respond in a similar way.

But if your baby or toddler starts crying, you need to help them settle. For example, you could calm them down with a cuddle, settle them to sleep in your arms or use hands-on settling. You can read about other ways to respond when your toddler calls out or gets out of bed.""
light-noise,""Light and sleep

A darker room means less stimulation around your child. This can help calm and settle them. A darkened room also tells your child that it’s time for rest.

Once your child is in bed, they might sleep better if the amount of light in the room stays the same while they’re asleep.

Noise and sleep

Some children can settle for sleep and stay asleep with a little bit of background noise. Others prefer a quiet environment. And children often wake up easily to sudden noises or to changes in the amount of background noise.

It might be easier for your child to go to sleep and stay asleep when noise levels are kept consistent.

Tips for managing light and noise

These tips can help you reduce light and keep noise consistent in your child’s sleep environment:

Block out sudden noises. You could close the windows and doors, hang heavier curtains or a blanket over windows, and/or put a draft blocker under the door.

Block out morning light and noise with closed windows and doors, window coverings and so on. If your child can’t hear the sounds of traffic or other early risers, it might help your child sleep longer in the morning.

Try low-level noise in the room where your child sleeps. Soft music can help children fall asleep. White noise or rain sounds might soothe your child if they wake easily. These can also block out sudden noises.

Try dimming the lights as you get your baby or young child ready for bed. In the daytime, closing blinds or curtains will help your child sleep.""
help-with-sleep-settling,""Why you might need help with baby sleep and toddler sleep

Babies and children need sleep to grow and develop well. Good sleep is also important for their health and immunity.

So if your baby isn’t settling or sleeping well, your baby might not be getting the sleep they need for health and development.

You’re probably not getting enough sleep either. You need sleep for your health and wellbeing. And your child is more likely to grow, develop and thrive when you’re physically, emotionally and mentally well.

That’s why it’s a good idea to get help for your baby’s sleep, if you need it.

Who can help you with baby sleep and toddler sleep

To get help with your baby’s sleep, you can talk to:

child and family health nurses

GPs

paediatricians, particularly those who specialise in child and baby sleep

some child and family psychologists.

How professionals can help with baby sleep and toddler sleep

First, the professional will talk with you to understand your concerns and your family’s needs. A good professional always finds out what your goals are for your child and your family – there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution.

The professional will ask you about your baby, your baby’s sleep, and the things you’ve tried so far. It can help to keep a diary of your baby’s sleep patterns and bring this when you see the professional.

The professional will then work with you to develop a baby sleep plan. They should help you put the plan into action and give you a copy of the plan so you can refer to it at home.

A good plan suits your baby’s needs and your family’s circumstances and cultural beliefs. It should cover:

good bedtime and sleep habits

positive bedtime routines

settling strategies that you’re comfortable using

things to try if the strategies in your baby sleep plan aren’t working.

Where to get help with baby sleep and toddler sleep

Child and family health centres

Your local child and family health centre is a good place to start. Your child and family health nurse can give you information and advice on your baby’s sleep and other early childhood concerns. Check our local services guides to find your nearest centre.

Parent helplines

Parenting helplines around Australia can help – and some are available after hours if you need help straight away. They can give you ideas about how to handle baby sleep concerns and tell you where to get help in your local area. Some helplines specialise in helping parents with babies and young children.

Early parenting centres

Early parenting centres – sometimes called ‘sleep schools’ – can help you learn to manage your baby’s sleep better. They can also give you help with settling, feeding and play routines for your baby or toddler, as well as supporting you with personal issues too.

Staff at early parenting centres understand what you and your baby are going through. They’re used to dealing with all kinds of feeding and settling problems. Different centres operate differently, but they’ll all work with you to develop a routine that encourages your baby to spend more time sleeping and less time crying.

When you call a centre, someone will speak to you about your needs and let you know what they can offer. This might be:

advice

referral to a parent education session

a day-stay program

a residential program.

If you go into a residential program, you’ll stay in a family unit with beds, a cot and everything you need, including in-house support. There might be a waiting list at some centres.

Most government parenting centres are free, because Medicare covers the cost. You might have to pay extra for things like nappies and meals.

Private centres offer the same service, but Medicare doesn’t cover the full cost. If you have private health insurance, you might be able to get some money back from your fund.

Your child and family health centre can tell you more about local parenting centres.

GP or paediatrician

Some babies and children are very difficult to settle and to get to sleep, no matter what you try. If this sounds like your situation, your baby might also benefit from seeing a paediatrician, particularly one who specialises in sleep and settling in babies and children. You could start by talking to your GP. They can refer you to a paediatrician and also check for any health or developmental concerns.

The child health professionals you talk to at early parenting centres, child and family health centres, and helplines will have plenty of strategies for you to try at home. As you start putting these strategies into practice, it can help to keep the following points in mind:

Be patient. It takes time to get used to new routines, and your baby might cry more or be more difficult to settle initially. Make a plan with the professional for how long you’ll try something before deciding that it isn’t working and trying something else.

Be consistent. Do your best to stick to the plan for your baby. Your baby will adapt better to changes in their sleep and settling habits if you’re consistent.

Keep your baby’s sleep plan handy. Reading your baby’s sleep plan again will remind you of what you need to do. When things aren’t working, you can double-check to see whether you’re following the strategies correctly. It’s OK to contact your professional again if you need help.

Try to organise back-up when you start new strategies. Find out who you can contact for help or emotional support. For example, most early parenting centres provide a telephone number for follow-up concerns. They have staff who can answer your questions.

Talk with your partner, if you have one, and make sure you agree on the plan. It’s less stressful for your family, and the plan is more likely to work when you and your partner agree.""
about-sleep,""Why is sleep important?

Sleep restores children physically. It helps them learn and remember things, and it boosts immunity. And sleep helps children grow. For example, children’s bodies produce growth hormone when they’re asleep.

Children of all ages need to get enough sleep so they can play, learn and concentrate during the day.

Sleep at different ages

Babies, children and teenagers need different amounts of sleep. For example, as babies and children get older, the amount of sleep they need slowly decreases.

Also, sleep patterns change as babies and children get older. For example, as babies get older, they begin to sleep less during the day and more at night.

Babies under 6 months: when and how much they sleep

Newborns

Newborns sleep on and off during the day and night. They sleep for 14-17 hours in every 24 hours.

They have 2 different kinds of sleep – active sleep and quiet sleep. In active sleep your baby moves around. You might see jerking, twitching or sucking. In quiet sleep your baby is still and breathing evenly.

Newborns move through active and quiet sleep in cycles that last about 40 minutes. They might wake up after a sleep cycle and need help getting back to sleep.

Babies 3-6 months

By 3 months, babies start to develop night and day sleep patterns, and they tend to start sleeping more during the night. Babies usually sleep for 12-15 hours in every 24 hours.

At 3-6 months, babies might start moving towards a pattern of 2-3 daytime sleeps of up to 2 hours each. They often wake at least once overnight.

Babies 6-12 months: when and how much they sleep

Sleep during the night

As babies develop, more of their sleep happens at night.

At this age, most babies are ready for bed between 6 pm and 10 pm. They usually take less than 40 minutes to get to sleep, but about 1 in 10 babies takes longer.

Babies might be having long sleeps of 6 hours at night by the time they’re 6 months old.

Almost two-thirds of babies wake only once during the night and need an adult to settle them back to sleep. About 1 in 10 babies calls out 3-4 times a night.

More than a third of parents say their babies have problems with sleep at this age.

Sleep during the day

Most babies aged 6-12 months still have 1-2 daytime naps. These naps usually last 30 minutes to 2 hours.

Toddlers: when and how much they sleep

Toddlers need 11-14 hours of sleep every 24 hours. Usually this is a sleep of 10-12 hours a night, and a nap of 1-2 hours during the day.

Some toddlers aren’t keen on going to bed at night. Often this is because they’d like to stay up with the family. This is the most common sleep problem reported by parents. It peaks around 18 months and improves with age.

Less than 5% of 2-year-olds wake 3 or more times overnight.

Preschoolers: when and how much they sleep

Children aged 3-5 years need 10-13 hours of sleep a night.

Some preschoolers might also have day naps that last for about an hour. When preschoolers get enough sleep overnight, they won’t need these naps anymore.

School-age children: when and how much they sleep

Children aged 5-11 years need 9-11 hours of sleep a night.

Children over 5 years of age rarely nap during the day. If your child often needs daytime naps, it’s good to check they’re getting enough sleep overnight. See your GP if you have concerns.

Primary school-age children are usually tired after school and might look forward to bedtime from about 7.30 pm.

Teenagers: when and how much they sleep

Children entering puberty generally need about 8-10 hours of sleep a night.

Changes to the circadian rhythm during adolescence mean it’s normal for teenagers to want to go to bed later at night – often around 11 pm or later – then get up later in the morning. Good daytime habits and sleep environment habits can help teenagers get enough sleep.

About sleep cycles

We all cycle between different types of sleep during the night and during long naps.

From about 6 months of age, a sleep cycle contains:

rapid eye movement (REM) sleep

non-REM sleep.

In REM sleep, your eyeballs flicker from side to side underneath your eyelids. REM sleep is also called dream sleep.

Non-REM sleep consists of deep sleep and light sleep. It’s harder to wake children who are in deep sleep, whereas children in light sleep wake up easily.

The amount of REM and non-REM sleep in a cycle changes throughout the night.

It’s also common to wake briefly between sleep cycles.

How sleep cycles affect children’s sleep

Children have a lot of deep non-REM sleep in the first few hours after they fall asleep. That’s why children sleep so soundly in the first few hours after they’ve gone to bed and are rarely disturbed by anything.

Children have more REM sleep and light non-REM sleep in the second half of the night. Children wake more easily from these kinds of sleep, so they might wake up more during this time than at the beginning of the night.

In the early childhood years, sleep cycles get longer as children get older. In children aged 3 years, sleep cycles are about 60 minutes. By about 5 years, sleep cycles have matured to the adult length of about 90 minutes."""
bedtime-fading-earlier-bedtimes-babies-toddlers,"What is bedtime fading?

Bedtime fading is gradually making your child’s bedtime earlier. It can help your child fall asleep earlier or spend less time awake in their cot or bed after bedtime.

Sometimes babies and young children take a long time to get to sleep. This can happen for many reasons. For example, your child might:

not be tired enough for sleep

be in the habit of being awake at that time

want to do a different activity like playing with you

not think of their cot or bed as a place just for sleeping.

Bedtime fading can help your child get the sleep they need to stay healthy, develop well, and play and learn. It can also help you get more time for resting or doing other things you want to do.

Step 1: choose a bedtime

Bedtimes between 7 pm and 8 pm often work for young children.

For example, your child is currently falling asleep around 9 pm, but you think it’s better for your child to fall asleep around 8 pm.

This makes 8 pm your ideal bedtime.

Step 2: introduce a positive bedtime routine

A positive bedtime routine helps soothe and calm your child so they’re ready for sleep. It’ll make it easier for your child to fall asleep.

If you introduce a bedtime routine at the same time as you start bedtime fading, it helps your child link the routine with going to sleep.

A bedtime routine involves doing similar things in the same order each night before bed. It can include:

pre-bed tasks like having a bath and brushing teeth

quiet, enjoyable activities with you, like reading or listening to a story.

It can also help to look at your child’s sleep habits and your child’s sleep environment. For example, dim light and low or no noise can help your child settle for sleep more easily.

Step 3: put your child to bed at their actual bedtime

Bedtime fading starts with putting your child to bed at the time they’re naturally falling asleep now. This helps your child learn to associate being in bed with feeling sleepy.

For example, if you find that your child finally falls asleep about 9 pm, start with this as a temporary bedtime.

Step 4: start moving your child’s actual bedtime towards the ideal bedtime

When your child is falling asleep well at the later time, you can start gradually making your child’s bedtime earlier. This might be about a week after you start bedtime fading.

This involves making bedtime about 15 minutes earlier every few days. You do this until you reach the ideal bedtime for your child.

This gradual approach gives your child’s body time to get used to falling asleep at the earlier time. For example, they might start waking up earlier and feeling tired earlier in the day.

The strategy will work best if you consistently put your child to bed on time while you’re trying to make their bedtime earlier.

Bedtime fading example

Your child has been falling asleep at 9 pm, but you think an 8 pm bedtime is better for your child. Here’s how to do bedtime fading:

Start your positive bedtime routine so that your child is ready for a 9 pm bedtime.

Do this for 2 nights.

Start your positive bedtime routine 15 minutes earlier than before, so your child is ready for an 8.45 pm bedtime.

Do this for 2 nights.

Continue this gradual ‘fading’ process until your child is going to bed at 8 pm or the time you think is best for them."
tired-signs,"Tired signs: why they’re important

Children show they’re tired through changes in behaviour. For example, your child might be suddenly irritable, overactive or demanding.

It’s important to look for your child’s ‘tired signs’. These signs let you know when it’s time to reduce stimulation and start settling your child for sleep.

Newborns: tired signs

Newborns can get tired very quickly. Some are tired as soon as 1-1½ hours after waking. Others can be happy and keep playing without tired signs for two hours or more.

If your newborn is tired, you might see some of the following tired signs:

pulling at ears

closing fists

yawning

fluttering eyelids or difficulty focusing – your baby might even go cross-eyed or seem to be staring into space

making jerky arm and leg movements, or arching backwards

frowning or looking worried

sucking on fingers – this could be a good sign and might mean that your baby is trying to find ways to settle to sleep.

Babies and toddlers: tired signs

At 3-6 months, your baby might be tired after 1½-3 hours awake.

At 6-12 months, your baby might be tired after 2-3 hours awake.

At 12-18 months, your child might be tired if they miss out on a morning or afternoon sleep.

If your baby or toddler is tired, you might see some of the following tired signs:

clumsiness

clinginess

grizzling or crying

demands for attention

boredom with toys

fussiness with food.

Tired or hungry?

If your baby has had a feed within the last two hours and is grizzling and cranky, baby might be tired. If you’re not sure, offer a feed. If your baby takes only a little milk and is still grizzly, try settling baby back to sleep.

Reducing stimulation

If your child is showing signs of tiredness, it’s a good idea to get them ready for sleep by reducing stimulation. You can do this by:

taking your child to the place where they usually sleep

putting toys away

talking quietly and soothingly

closing curtains and blinds

turning overhead lights off – use lamps if you need to

playing music quietly – this will help cut down on background noise.

Making quiet time

Some quiet time before bed in the place where your child usually sleeps will help your child settle to sleep.

Quiet time with your child might include a gentle cuddle, a story or a quiet song.

Your child might need only a few minutes of quiet time before they’re relaxed and ready to be put in bed. If your household is noisy and active, your child might need some extra quiet time before it’s time for sleep."
baby-sleep-problems,"Sleep: what babies and toddlers need

Babies and children need sleep to grow and develop well. Good sleep is also important for their health and immunity.

Some babies and toddlers can have trouble settling to sleep by themselves, so they cry. This can happen for many different reasons:

Some babies or toddlers cry when they’re tired but can’t settle to sleep.

Many babies or toddlers cry when they need help to settle back to sleep after waking in the night.

Many babies or toddlers cry when they’re getting used to a new or different way of going to sleep.

Sometimes happy, healthy babies or toddlers develop rapidly, which means they find it harder than usual to settle.

Babies and toddlers who are crying while trying to settle also need comfort.

It’s important to respond to your baby’s or toddler’s needs for:

sleep – for example, by putting a baby to sleep when you see baby’s tired signs

comfort – for example, by not leaving a crying baby alone for long periods.

Consistently responding to your baby’s or toddler’s needs for both sleep and comfort is an important part of bonding with your baby and helping your child grow up feeling safe, secure and cared for.

Adult sleep: what you need

You need sleep for your health and wellbeing.

Learning what helps your child to sleep and settle can mean that you get more sleep. And this can make a big difference to your health and wellbeing.

When you’re physically, emotionally and mentally well, your child is more likely to grow, develop and thrive.

Working out how to meet your child’s needs and your needs

There are many ways to meet your child’s needs for both sleep and comfort, as well as your own need for rest. You might have to try a few different approaches to sleep, settling and comforting to work out what’s right for you and your child.

It might help to know that all the strategies on this website are thoroughly researched. The evidence says that these strategies are safe. And if you have plenty of warm and loving interactions with your child while they’re awake, these strategies can support your child’s wellbeing and development, and also your relationship with your child.

Getting help with baby or toddler sleep and settling

If your baby’s or toddler’s sleep and settling is causing you concern or stress, it’s a very good idea to get professional help with sleep and settling, especially if you’re not sure what the problem is or how to put a sleep strategy into action.

If your baby or toddler has difficulty settling, it’s a good idea to talk with your GP or child and family health nurse. This can help to rule out any underlying health concerns that might be causing unsettled sleep."
night-terrors,"What are night terrors in children?

Night terrors (or sleep terrors) are when children suddenly get very agitated while in a state of deep sleep.

During night terrors, children might look like they’re in a panic. Their hearts might be racing, and they might be breathing fast and sweating.

Children might also look like they’re awake during night terrors. For example, their eyes might be open or they might be crying. They might look confused or dazed. Some children might even sit up or get out of bed and run around. They might talk too, although it might not make sense.

But children are asleep during night terrors, so they won’t respond when someone tries to comfort them.

Night terrors happen suddenly and often start with a cry or scream. They usually settle down in 10-15 minutes, but they can last longer than this. They don’t usually happen more than once a night. Sometimes they happen regularly for weeks or months and then go away.

What to do if your child has night terrors

Here’s what to do – and what not to do – if your child has night terrors:

Avoid waking your child during a night terror. A child having a night terror will only be confused and disorientated if you wake them. If you leave your child asleep, the night terror will be over more quickly and your child won’t remember it happened.

Wait for your child to stop thrashing around. Guide your child back to bed (if they get out) and tuck them in. Your child will usually settle back to sleep quickly at this stage. If you think your child might get hurt, stay close to guide your child away from hitting or bumping the cot or bed or other obstacles.

Try a regular bedtime routine of bath, story and bed. This can help children feel ready for sleep and help them get more sleep. Lack of sleep can cause night terrors in some children.

If your child is having regular night terrors around the same time each night, try gently waking your child briefly about half an hour before the usual night terror time and resettling them. This works for some children.

If your child gets up and moves around during their night terrors, make sure the bedroom and other areas of the house are safe for your child.

When to get help for night terrors

If your child is having night terrors along with breathing problems like snoring, talk with your GP about an ear, nose and throat assessment.

It can help to keep a sleep diary that describes when and where your child sleeps and how often your child has night terrors. You can share this information with your GP if you’re concerned that your child isn’t getting enough good-quality sleep or if your child’s night terrors are frequent and violent or continue over many months.

What causes night terrors in children?

A common cause of night terrors is a lack of good-quality sleep.

Also, children are more likely to have night terrors if they’re not well. Fever and certain medicines can increase the likelihood of night terrors.

Night terrors can run in families. Your child is more likely to have night terrors if someone else in the family has had them.

Night terrors and nightmares

Night terrors are different from nightmares.

Children are usually awake and distressed after a nightmare, but they sleep through night terrors and don’t remember them when they wake up.

Night terrors happen during the first few hours of sleep, when your child is sleeping very deeply. Nightmares tend to happen in the second half of the night, when your child is sleeping lightly and dreaming.

Night terrors are less common than nightmares, but they still affect about 1 in 20 children."
body-rocking-head-rolling-head-banging,"Sleep issues: body-rocking, head-rolling and head-banging

It’s common to see young children body-rocking, head-rolling and head-banging at bedtime or during the night. They do it because it’s rhythmic and it comforts and soothes them.

Children might:

get on their hands and knees and rock back and forth, hitting their foreheads on the bedhead or edges of the cot

sit in bed and bang their heads backwards against the bedhead

lie face down and bang their heads and chests into the pillow or mattress

lie on their backs and move their heads or bodies from side to side

make noises while they’re rocking.

Simple tips to handle body-rocking, head-rolling and head-banging at bedtime

If your child is developing well in all other ways, you might decide to put up with the body-rocking, head-rolling or head-banging. This behaviour will eventually go away.

Here are other ideas that might help:

Think about how long your child is spending in bed before falling asleep. Too much time awake in bed might result in head-banging and body-rocking.

Avoid giving the behaviour your attention. Children might behave this way more if it seems to keep you around at bedtime.

If your child is in a bed, remove bedside tables or other hard surfaces, and move the bed well away from walls. This will help to stop bruising or thickening of your child’s skin in the spot where they bang their head.

When to get help for rocking, rolling and banging

Head-banging might result in red marks, slight bruising or skin thickening on children’s heads. For most children, this doesn’t cause any serious or permanent injury.

But if head-banging, rocking or rolling happens a lot through the night and your child also snores, it’s a good idea to talk with your child’s GP. The GP will check for things that might be disturbing your child’s sleep, like obstructive sleep apnoea.

Also, sometimes children rock, roll and bang their heads more if they’re experiencing anxiety or stress during the day. If you’re concerned about your child’s mental health, check in with your GP.

Body-rocking and head-banging can be particularly intense in some children, including children with developmental delay, autism or blindness. These children are also more likely to rock or bang during the day. For these children, the rocking and banging can be harmful."
calling-out-getting-out-of-bed,"Getting out of bed or calling out: why children do it

Children call out or get out of bed for many reasons.

Sometimes children call out or get out of bed because they genuinely need attention. For example, your child might need to go to the toilet, or there might be a spider on the wall.

Sometimes they do it because they’ve learned something new as a natural part of development. For example, they’re big enough to climb out of the cot. Likewise, from around 6-7 months, many children develop separation anxiety. Because of this, they might want you to stay with them at bedtime. Or sometimes children want to stay up with the family.

Children can also have trouble settling back into their sleep routines after illness.

Or children might suddenly start having bedtime or sleep issues after a big change or loss in their lives. This can be a sign that they’re having some stress or anxiety.

What to do when children call out or get out of bed

If you think your child is calling out or getting out of bed because they need your help or something is wrong, go in to your child.

If you think your child is calling out or getting out of bed as a way of keeping you around at bedtime and you’re happy to keep resettling them, that’s OK.

If you think your child’s sleep issues are caused by stress or anxiety, or if your child seems very afraid or worried about night-time or about separating from you, it’s a good idea to see a health professional. You could start by talking to your GP or child and family health nurse.

But if calling out or getting out of bed is something you’d like to change, start by helping your child settle with a regular bedtime routine. Then deal with the calling out or getting out of bed calmly and consistently.

Setting up a bedtime routine

A bedtime routine is the most important part of helping young children go to bed and settle. A basic routine involves:

doing the same soothing things at the same time each night before bed

avoiding loud or boisterous play before bedtime

avoiding screen-based activity in the hour before bedtime – that is, avoiding TV, computer games or tablets and other devices.

Here are some things to think about when you’re setting up or changing a bedtime routine to deal with calling out or getting out of bed.

Think about timing

If your child is taking a long time to fall asleep, you might be putting your child to bed too early.

If your child takes more than 30 minutes to fall asleep, try making your child’s bedtime closer to the time your child can actually fall asleep. This is called bedtime fading, and it will make it more likely that your child will settle to sleep rather than getting up and down.

Once your child is falling asleep regularly at a later time, you can slowly make the bedtime earlier. For example, make your child’s bedtime earlier by 15 minutes every 3 nights until you get to the bedtime you want.

If your child starts calling out or getting out of bed again at a particular time, you might need to keep that time for another few nights before gradually making it earlier.

Do a quick check before lights out

Before turning out the light, check that your child has done all the things that might cause calling out later. Has your child had a drink? Been to the toilet? Brushed teeth?

Turn on a night-light if this makes your child feel more comfortable.

Remind your child of what you expect

Before you leave the bedroom, you can say that you want your child to stay quietly in bed – for example, ‘It’s time to rest quietly in bed’. You can also say, ‘I’ll come back and check on you once you’re quiet’.

Next you can say ‘Goodnight’, ‘I love you, sleep tight’ or whatever you usually say when your child goes to bed. And then walk out of the bedroom.

Praise your child for being quiet

If you go back to check on your child, give them some brief and gentle praise – for example, ‘Well done for staying in bed. You’re doing a good job of quiet resting’. You can phase out these checks as your child gets better at settling themselves.

Aim for consistency

Bedtime routines work best when they’re used consistently by all the grown-ups who settle your child.

Dealing with calling out and getting out of bed

Even with a positive bedtime routine, you might find your child still calls out or gets out of bed. If you’re aiming to help your child learn to settle without calling out or getting out of bed, you need to be consistent in responding to this behaviour.

If your child calls out, you can call back briefly to reassure your child that you’re close. But if you’re confident that your child has everything they need, it’s OK not to go in. For example, if your child has had enough to drink, it’s OK not to take in an extra drink of water. If your child has already had their bedtime stories, it’s OK not to go in with another book.

If your child gets out of bed, you can say something like ‘It’s time to sleep. Please stay in your bed’. Then return your child gently and calmly to bed, without talking or scolding. Do this as many times as it takes until your child stays in bed.

Some children come out of their bedrooms over and over. If it feels like returning your child to the bedroom repeatedly isn’t working, you can put up a child gate. If your child keeps coming out, you could say, ‘If you don’t stay in bed, I’ll close the gate and open it again when you’re staying in bed. Would you like one more chance?’ Then close the gate if your child doesn’t stay in bed.

Try a ‘free pass’

A strategy that might work with children over 3 years is the ‘free pass’:

At bedtime, give your child a ‘pass’ that’s good for one acceptable request, like a drink of water or a kiss from mum or dad.

Agree with your child that after they use the pass once, they must give it to you. It’s time for your child to settle without any calling out or getting out of bed.

If your child doesn’t use the pass, they can use it the next day or another time for a special activity you’ve agreed to beforehand.

If your child asks for something that’s not acceptable – for example, an ice-cream, or staying up later – your child must hand in the pass and can’t use it later.

What to do if children get very upset

Your child might not like it if you don’t come when they call, or you return them to their room each time they get out of bed. Your child might cry a lot, get very red in the face, cough or have a tantrum.

If your child gets very upset, you can comfort your child the same way you’d comfort them during the day. When your child is calm and back in bed, remind your child gently about staying in bed, say goodnight, and walk out again.

If this keeps happening or you’re worried about your child, it’s best to speak with your GP or child and family health nurse for advice. They can help you find specialists or services in your area if needed.

Starting the next day in a positive way

Make a point of praising or rewarding your child the next morning for staying quietly in bed. You could even celebrate with a special breakfast surprise or a phone call to a special person.

If your child is 3 years or older, you could try a reward chart to encourage the bedtime behaviour you want. Younger children often like a special stamp on their hand to remind them during the day what a good job they did overnight.

Even if there was calling out or getting up at night, you don’t need to talk about it the next morning. Try to start the next day in a positive way."
dummies-helping-your-child-let-go,"Weaning children off dummies: things to consider

Children can become very attached to their dummies. Touching and sucking on a dummy can comfort and soothe them. And dummies can also help young children manage everyday stress and soothe themselves when you’re not around.

But there are disadvantages to dummies. For example, your child might be waking a lot at night when they lose the dummy. Also, dummy use, especially beyond about 4-5 years of age, increases the chance of dental problems later in childhood – for example, the problem of children’s teeth growing out of line. And dummy use is linked to slightly higher rates of middle ear infections.

Sometimes children decide to give up their dummies by themselves. Most often, parents are the ones who decide it’s time to give it up. As a parent, you know your child best. You’re the best one to decide whether your child is ready to move on from the dummy. Try not to feel rushed or pressured by the reactions of family, other children or even strangers.

Your child probably won’t find it easy to part with the dummy. So if you feel it’s time for the dummy to go, a gradual approach is the fairest and easiest.

Tips for weaning off dummies

Here are things you can do before you begin to reduce your child’s dummy use:

Remind yourself that sucking a dummy never becomes a lifelong habit. Many children will stop using a dummy by themselves.

Choose your timing. A period of change or stress for you or your child might not be a good time to give up.

Talk to your child about giving up the dummy, if your child is old enough to understand.

When you and your child are ready to begin, try these ideas:

Try using the dummy for comforting less often during the day. You can do this by putting the dummy away in a special spot and then getting it out only as part of the sleep routine. This will help things go faster.

Limit dummy use to certain times and places – for example, the car or cot. This gives your child a chance to get used to being without the dummy.

Gradually use the dummy less and less when re-settling your child during the night. For example, give the dummy to your child every second time they cry in the night on the second day, then every third time on the third day, and so on.

Once your child is coping for longer periods without the dummy, set a time and date – then take away the dummy. These ideas might help:

Mark the occasion of becoming dummy free with a celebration or special reward.

Try not to turn back. No matter how well you’ve prepared your child for this change, expect some discomfort and protest."
sleep-medicines,"Children’s sleep problems: sleep medicine or other strategies?

If your child is having trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep, medicine won’t necessarily fix the problem.

In Australia, sleep medicines are rarely used to help children sleep because medicines can have side effects. Even herbal or ‘natural’ remedies can have side effects.

Before you look into sleep medicines, it’s always best to try sleep and lifestyle changes to help your child sleep better. These changes include:

introducing better sleep habits

limiting food and drinks with caffeine

doing more physical activity.

Using sleep medicines for children

Sometimes sleep problems continue even after children try better sleep habits and makes other changes. These problems are called persistent sleep problems. When children have persistent sleep problems, doctors might sometimes prescribe a medicine like melatonin or a sedative.

If your doctor prescribes sleep medicine for your child, the doctor will recommend behaviour strategies for your child as well. This combined approach will help to resolve your child’s problems faster. It also means the medicine won’t be needed for as long, and your child will keep sleeping better when they stop taking the medicine.

Some sleep medicines are available without a prescription – for example, in health food shops or over the counter in pharmacies. If you want to use one of these medicines, always talk about it with your doctor first.

And always check with your doctor or pharmacist about the side effects of over-the-counter and prescribed sleep medicines.

Herbal sleep remedies

Herbal or ‘natural’ sleep remedies – like chamomile, hops, passion flower and St John’s wort – are available in many health food shops, but there isn’t much evidence to show that they help with sleep problems.

Valerian, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (fish oil) might improve sleep quality in some people. These supplements don’t have many side effects, but overall there isn’t enough evidence to show that they help.

Herbal sleep remedies don’t go through the same testing as medicines prescribed by your doctor or bought over the counter at your pharmacy.

Melatonin

Melatonin is a hormone produced naturally by your brain when it gets dark at night. It helps your body to fall asleep at night. It also helps to maintain your body clock from day to day.

Your doctor might prescribe melatonin if your child has additional needs like autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or visual problems including blindness. Your doctor might also prescribe melatonin if your child has a persistent sleep problem or trouble falling asleep and waking up in the morning.

If your child is taking melatonin, they need to be settled and ready for bed before having their nightly dose. This is because melatonin usually works within 30-60 minutes. You shouldn’t give melatonin to your child except under direct medical advice and supervision.

Doctors might prescribe melatonin for children with additional needs, but the Therapeutic Goods Administration has not approved melatonin for use by typically developing children.

Sedative medicines

Sedative medicines include Vallergan and Phenergan. Your child should take sedative medicines only under the supervision of your doctor.

These medicines aren’t recommended for children under 2 years of age. They can cause side effects like crankiness, hyperactivity, challenging behaviour and daytime drowsiness in some children.

Sedative medicine are very unlikely to help with your child’s sleep problems unless your child uses them in combination with behaviour strategies focused on their bedtime routine.

Sleeping tablets

Sleeping tablets – for example, benzodiazepines – are sometimes prescribed for adults with sleep problems, but their effects in children haven’t been studied enough. In rare situations your doctor might prescribe a sleeping tablet for your child under careful medical supervision and usually only for a limited time.

Some sleeping tablets can be addictive. Also, it’s never safe to give your child medicine prescribed for someone else.

Other prescription medicines

If your child is autistic or has ADHD, behaviour problems, developmental delay or a condition like cerebral palsy and is also sleeping poorly, discuss this with your doctor. The doctor might be able to prescribe additional medicines for your child’s sleep problems."
sleep-20-faqs,"Is my child getting enough sleep? How much sleep do children need?

If your child has good energy levels, feels refreshed, wakes independently in the morning at a reasonable time, and doesn’t complain of tiredness or sleepiness, your child is probably getting enough sleep.

You can check the recommended amount of sleep for children of different ages in these articles:

Toddler sleep: what to expect
Preschooler sleep: what to expect
School-age and pre-teen sleep: what to expect
Sleep and teenagers: 12-18 years.
If you’re concerned about the amount of sleep your child is getting, see your GP.

My child twitches as they fall asleep. What’s happening?

These twitches are probably ‘sleep starts’ – quick jerks of the arms and legs that happen as your child falls asleep. Up to 70% of children and grown-ups have sleep starts. Tiredness, stress or lack of sleep might make them worse, so it can be worth checking your child’s sleep habits. If the jerks are repetitive rather than just 1-2 quick movements or if they happen throughout the night, you should check with your GP.

Why do I have to wake my school-age child for school?

If you have to wake your child in the morning, it might be because they’re not getting enough sleep for a school-age child. Most primary school-age children wake by themselves in the morning if they’re getting enough sleep. Check your child’s sleep habits, and always see your GP if you’re concerned.

My child snores and gasps at night. Should I be worried?

Snoring can be caused by a cold or a blocked nose. It’ll usually stop when the illness has gone.

If the snoring doesn’t go away and happens most nights, even when your child is well, it could be a sign of obstructive sleep apnoea. See your GP if your child has been snoring over a long period, stops breathing during sleep, gasps and struggles for breath overnight, tosses and turns at night, or sweats a lot overnight.

When should a child stop napping? How long should a nap be?

About a quarter of children stop napping by 3 years. Another half stop at 3-4 years. Most children have stopped napping by 5 years if they’re getting enough sleep at night. Naps can range from 20 minutes to around 2 hours, depending on your child’s age.

If your child isn’t tired at bedtime or is having trouble getting to sleep, encourage your child to have a shorter nap earlier in the day – for example, a nap straight after lunch.

What does it mean if my child wakes up grumpy?

The most likely reason for your child waking up grumpy is that your child hasn’t had enough sleep. But if your child is sleeping the right amount for their age, waking up grumpy might mean that your child isn’t getting good-quality sleep. If your child is snoring or very restless overnight, see your GP to have your child checked for a sleep problem.

How do I get my child to sleep before midnight?

Here are ideas to help your child get to sleep earlier:

Encourage your child to go to bed and get up around the same time every day, even on the weekend. This can help your child’s internal body clock get into a regular rhythm.

Discourage late-night eating, and encourage your child to have a healthy breakfast.

Allow plenty of time – for example, an hour – for your child to wind down before lights out. Encourage quiet activities like reading a book or magazine, drawing, writing, playing card games or doing puzzles.

Avoid digital technology use in the hour before bedtime. This includes mobile phones, tablets, computer screens and TV.

During puberty, children start to secrete melatonin later at night than they did in earlier childhood. This affects their circadian rhythm. It means that your child will want to go to bed later at night and get up later in the morning.

Your teenage child will probably sleep better and function better during the day with a set bedtime for school nights. You can find more information in our illustrated guide to better sleep for teenagers.

What can I do during the day to improve my child’s sleep?

These daytime tips might improve your child’s sleep at night:

Give your child a healthy breakfast to kick-start your child’s internal body clock.

Encourage your child to get as much natural light as possible during the day, especially in the morning.

Encourage your child to be physically active.

Encourage your child to avoid caffeine – in energy drinks, coffee, tea, chocolate and cola – especially in the late afternoon and evening.

Make sure your child has a satisfying evening meal at a reasonable time, so they’re neither full nor hungry at bedtime.

My child gets overexcited at bedtime when my partner gets home from work. What can we do?

Your child might find it fun and exciting when your partner gets home. And your partner probably wants to spend some time with your child too. This is a problem only if it leads to noisy, active play that makes it harder for your child to settle into bed for sleep.

Talk with your partner about a family routine that includes quiet time under dim light leading up to your child’s bedtime. For example, your partner might be able to read quietly with your child before lights out.

How can I move my child’s bedtime earlier?

You can use a gradual approach called bedtime fading. Starting with your child’s current bedtime, you do your child’s bedtime routine 15 minutes earlier every few days.

How can I get my child to sleep in their own bed?

If your child likes to sleep somewhere other than their own bed and you want to change this, you can look at changing your child’s bedtime routine and sleep habits. It’s a good idea to explain your plans to your child first.

Here are ideas to help your child fall asleep in their own bed and stay in their own bed overnight:

Set up a regular bedtime routine – for example, bath, story and bed.

Think about timing. If your child is taking a long time to get to sleep, you might be putting your child to bed too early.

Check that your child’s bedroom is dimly lit and quiet.

Encourage your child to play in their bedroom during the day so they feel comfortable in that room.

Encourage good daytime habits – for example, getting plenty of sunlight and exercise.

Praise your child when you notice they’re trying to make changes to sleep patterns. You could also try a reward chart.

How do I deal with my child’s fears and worries at bedtime?

You could try sleep relaxation strategies to handle bedtime worries. For example, talk about your child’s fears together or get your child to try writing their thoughts in a journal. Breathing exercises and muscle relaxation exercises might also help.

How do I stop my child from calling out and getting out of bed at night?

If your child is calling out and getting out of bed a lot, it can help to set up a bedtime routine and do a bedtime check that your child has done all the things that might cause calling out later. Has your child had a drink? Been to the toilet? Brushed teeth? Once your child is in bed, let your child know that you expect them to stay quietly in their bed until sleep comes. But always go to your child if something is wrong or they need your help.

What do I do about my child’s head-banging and rocking to sleep?

It’s common to see young children head-banging, body-rocking and head-rolling at bedtime or during the night. Most children stop this behaviour by 5 years.

If your child is developing well in all other ways, you could work on ways to reduce the noise and keep your child safe. For example, you could move the bed away from the wall and check and tighten the bed screws. Sometimes moving the mattress onto the floor in the middle of the room can ease the disruption to the rest of the family.

See your GP if head-banging, body-rocking and head-rolling happen a lot through the night or are particularly intense, or if you’re worried.

My 3-year-old asks for bottles of milk overnight. What should I do?

This is probably happening because your child has a habit of needing a bottle to fall asleep. When your child wakes and can’t get back to sleep during the night, they call for a bottle.

If your child uses a bottle only at night and is weaned from daytime feeds, check out our article on night-weaning.

If your child still has a bottle during the day, check out our article on weaning off the bottle.

My child sleepwalks. What should I do?

You can start by checking that your child is getting enough sleep. An earlier or more regular bedtime might reduce sleepwalking.

If your child is sleepwalking, make sure they’re safe by clearing obstacles from the bedroom and hallways, locking the front and back doors, removing trip hazards and checking there are no sharp objects around.

Around 7-15% of children sleepwalk, and many sleep talk too. Usually, it’s nothing to worry about. Children often grow out of these habits in the teenage years, but see your GP if you’re worried.

My child sometimes wakes up distressed, crying and inconsolable. What should I do?

If your child won’t respond to comforting or soothing but is otherwise well, your child might be having a night terror. Stay calm and avoid waking or touching your child unless your child is at risk of hurting themselves. Night terrors can be distressing to watch, but they don’t harm your child, and your child won’t remember them in the morning.

If you’re worried about your child’s health or wellbeing or the night terrors seem prolonged or violent, see your GP.

What should I do when my child has a nightmare?

If your child wakes up after a nightmare, explain that it was a bad dream. Let your child know that everything is OK and they’re safe. A kiss and a cuddle might help your child settle again. You could also think about things that are happening during the day – like watching a scary TV show – that might be causing the nightmares.

It can be a good idea to seek professional advice if your child is having recurrent or frequent nightmares and is also having a lot of anxiety during the day. Also seek help if your child has been through a traumatic event and is having nightmares about it.

My autistic child has poor sleep. How can I help?

Sleep difficulties are common in autistic children. You can manage and overcome many sleep problems by using common positive behaviour strategies. You can also encourage good sleep habits for autistic children, including regular sleep times, positive bedtime routines and appropriate bedtimes. Sometimes you might need professional help from your GP, a paediatrician or a sleep specialist.

My child has a developmental delay. How can I help them sleep better?

You can manage and overcome many of your child’s sleep issues using common bedtime positive behaviour strategies. A regular and predictable bedtime routine will help your child know that it’s time for sleep. Telling your child that you expect them to stay in bed will reinforce the message.

You might also try strategies like camping out or returning your child to bed. Some nights you might need to take your child back to bed several times. Talk to your health professional if you’re worried."
