### Why is sleep important? ###
Sleep restores children physically. It helps them learn and remember things, and it boosts immunity. And sleep helps children grow. For example, children’s bodies produce growth hormone when they’re asleep.

Children of all ages need to get enough sleep so they can play, learn and concentrate during the day.

### Sleep at different ages ###
Babies, children and teenagers need different amounts of sleep. For example, as babies and children get older, the amount of sleep they need slowly decreases.

Also, sleep patterns change as babies and children get older. For example, as babies get older, they begin to sleep less during the day and more at night.

### Babies under 6 months: when and how much they sleep ###
#### Newborns ####
Newborns sleep on and off during the day and night. They sleep for 14-17 hours in every 24 hours.

They have 2 different kinds of sleep – active sleep and quiet sleep. In active sleep your baby moves around. You might see jerking, twitching or sucking. In quiet sleep your baby is still and breathing evenly.

Newborns move through active and quiet sleep in cycles that last about 40 minutes. They might wake up after a sleep cycle and need help getting back to sleep.

#### Babies 3-6 months ####
By 3 months, babies start to develop night and day sleep patterns, and they tend to start sleeping more during the night. Babies usually sleep for 12-15 hours in every 24 hours.

At 3-6 months, babies might start moving towards a pattern of 2-3 daytime sleeps of up to 2 hours each. They often wake at least once overnight.

### Babies 6-12 months: when and how much they sleep ####
#### Sleep during the night ####
As babies develop, more of their sleep happens at night.

At this age, most babies are ready for bed between 6 pm and 10 pm. They usually take less than 40 minutes to get to sleep, but about 1 in 10 babies takes longer.

Babies might be having long sleeps of 6 hours at night by the time they’re 6 months old.

Almost two-thirds of babies wake only once during the night and need an adult to settle them back to sleep. About 1 in 10 babies calls out 3-4 times a night.

More than a third of parents say their babies have problems with sleep at this age.

#### Sleep during the day ####
Most babies aged 6-12 months still have 1-2 daytime naps. These naps usually last 30 minutes to 2 hours.

### Toddlers: when and how much they sleep ###
Toddlers need 11-14 hours of sleep every 24 hours. Usually this is a sleep of 10-12 hours a night, and a nap of 1-2 hours during the day.

Some toddlers aren’t keen on going to bed at night. Often this is because they’d like to stay up with the family. This is the most common sleep problem reported by parents. It peaks around 18 months and improves with age.

Less than 5% of 2-year-olds wake 3 or more times overnight.

### Preschoolers: when and how much they sleep ###
Children aged 3-5 years need 10-13 hours of sleep a night.

Some preschoolers might also have day naps that last for about an hour. When preschoolers get enough sleep overnight, they won’t need these naps anymore.

### School-age children: when and how much they sleep ###
Children aged 5-11 years need 9-11 hours of sleep a night.

Children over 5 years of age rarely nap during the day. If your child often needs daytime naps, it’s good to check they’re getting enough sleep overnight. See your GP if you have concerns.

Primary school-age children are usually tired after school and might look forward to bedtime from about 7.30 pm.

### Teenagers: when and how much they sleep ###
Children entering puberty generally need about 8-10 hours of sleep a night.

Changes to the circadian rhythm during adolescence mean it’s normal for teenagers to want to go to bed later at night – often around 11 pm or later – then get up later in the morning. Good daytime habits and sleep environment habits can help teenagers get enough sleep.

### About sleep cycles ###
We all cycle between different types of sleep during the night and during long naps.

From about 6 months of age, a sleep cycle contains:

- rapid eye movement (REM) sleep
- non-REM sleep.

In REM sleep, your eyeballs flicker from side to side underneath your eyelids. REM sleep is also called dream sleep.

Non-REM sleep consists of deep sleep and light sleep. It’s harder to wake children who are in deep sleep, whereas children in light sleep wake up easily.

The amount of REM and non-REM sleep in a cycle changes throughout the night.

It’s also common to wake briefly between sleep cycles.

### How sleep cycles affect children’s sleep ###
Children have a lot of deep non-REM sleep in the first few hours after they fall asleep. That’s why children sleep so soundly in the first few hours after they’ve gone to bed and are rarely disturbed by anything.

Children have more REM sleep and light non-REM sleep in the second half of the night. Children wake more easily from these kinds of sleep, so they might wake up more during this time than at the beginning of the night.

In the early childhood years, sleep cycles get longer as children get older. In children aged 3 years, sleep cycles are about 60 minutes. By about 5 years, sleep cycles have matured to the adult length of about 90 minutes.
