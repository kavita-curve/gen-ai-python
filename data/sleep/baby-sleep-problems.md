### Sleep: what babies and toddlers need ###
Babies and children need sleep to grow and develop well. Good sleep is also important for their health and immunity.

Some babies and toddlers can have trouble settling to sleep by themselves, so they cry. This can happen for many different reasons:

- Some babies or toddlers cry when they’re tired but can’t settle to sleep.
- Many babies or toddlers cry when they need help to settle back to sleep after waking in the night.
- Many babies or toddlers cry when they’re getting used to a new or different way of going to sleep.
- Sometimes happy, healthy babies or toddlers develop rapidly, which means they find it harder than usual to settle.

Babies and toddlers who are crying while trying to settle also need comfort.

It’s important to respond to your baby’s or toddler’s needs for:

- sleep – for example, by putting a baby to sleep when you see baby’s tired signs
- comfort – for example, by not leaving a crying baby alone for long periods.

Consistently responding to your baby’s or toddler’s needs for both sleep and comfort is an important part of bonding with your baby and helping your child grow up feeling safe, secure and cared for.
