### What are night terrors in children? ###
Night terrors (or sleep terrors) are when children suddenly get very agitated while in a state of deep sleep.

During night terrors, children might look like they’re in a panic. Their hearts might be racing, and they might be breathing fast and sweating.

Children might also look like they’re awake during night terrors. For example, their eyes might be open or they might be crying. They might look confused or dazed. Some children might even sit up or get out of bed and run around. They might talk too, although it might not make sense.

But children are asleep during night terrors, so they won’t respond when someone tries to comfort them.

Night terrors happen suddenly and often start with a cry or scream. They usually settle down in 10-15 minutes, but they can last longer than this. They don’t usually happen more than once a night. Sometimes they happen regularly for weeks or months and then go away.


### What to do if your child has night terrors ###
Here’s what to do – and what not to do – if your child has night terrors:

- Avoid waking your child during a night terror. A child having a night terror will only be confused and disorientated if you wake them. If you leave your child asleep, the night terror will be over more quickly and your child won’t remember it happened.
- Wait for your child to stop thrashing around. Guide your child back to bed (if they get out) and tuck them in. Your child will usually settle back to sleep quickly at this stage. If you think your child might get hurt, stay close to guide your child away from hitting or bumping the cot or bed or other obstacles.
- Try a regular bedtime routine of bath, story and bed. This can help children feel ready for sleep and help them get more sleep. Lack of sleep can cause night terrors in some children.
- If your child is having regular night terrors around the same time each night, try gently waking your child briefly about half an hour before the usual night terror time and resettling them. This works for some children.
- If your child gets up and moves around during their night terrors, make sure the bedroom and other areas of the house are safe for your child.

### When to get help for night terrors ###
If your child is having night terrors along with breathing problems like snoring, talk with your GP about an ear, nose and throat assessment.

It can help to keep a sleep diary that describes when and where your child sleeps and how often your child has night terrors. You can share this information with your GP if you’re concerned that your child isn’t getting enough good-quality sleep or if your child’s night terrors are frequent and violent or continue over many months.

### What causes night terrors in children? ###
A common cause of night terrors is a lack of good-quality sleep.

Also, children are more likely to have night terrors if they’re not well. Fever and certain medicines can increase the likelihood of night terrors.

Night terrors can run in families. Your child is more likely to have night terrors if someone else in the family has had them.

### Night terrors and nightmares ###
Night terrors are different from nightmares.

Children are usually awake and distressed after a nightmare, but they sleep through night terrors and don’t remember them when they wake up.

Night terrors happen during the first few hours of sleep, when your child is sleeping very deeply. Nightmares tend to happen in the second half of the night, when your child is sleeping lightly and dreaming.

Night terrors are less common than nightmares, but they still affect about 1 in 20 children.
